text: What was the conclusion of the study ?	labels:  In both bat species, the strongest antiviral responses were countered by the virus spreading more quickly from cell to cell. This suggests that bat immune defenses may drive the evolution of faster transmitting viruses, and while bats are well protected from the harmful effects of their own prolific viruses, other creatures like humans are not.	episode_done:True

We used generalized additive models to infer the time course of all cell culture replicates and construct the multi-trial dataset to which we eventually fit our mechanistic transmission model for each cell line-virus-specific combinatio	episode_done:True
text: How was the modeling carried out?	labels: an innovative combination of in vitro experimentation and within-host modeling to explore the impact of unique bat immunity on virus dynamics.	episode_done:True
text: What was the finding in this study?	labels: that bat cell lines demonstrated a signature of enhanced interferon-mediated immune response, of either constitutive or induced form, which allowed for establishment of rapid within-host, cell-to-cell virus transmission rates 	episode_done:True
text: What supports the results?	labels: by both data-independent bifurcation analysis of our mean field theoretical model, as well as fitting of this model to viral infection time series established in bat cell culture.	episode_done:True
text: What was additionally demonstrated?	labels: the antiviral state induced by the interferon pathway protects live cells from mortality in tissue culture, resulting in in vitro epidemics of extended duration that enhance the probability of establishing a long-term persistent infection.	episode_done:True
text: What do  the studies suggest?	labels: that viruses evolved in bat reservoirs possessing enhanced IFN capabilities could achieve more rapid within-host transmission rates without causing pathology to their hosts. Such rapidly-reproducing viruses would likely generate extreme virulence upon spillover to hosts lacking similar immune capacities to bats.	episode_done:True
text: What was the methodology for this study?	labels: we first developed a novel, within-host, theoretical model elucidating the effects of unique bat immunity, then undertook bifurcation analysis of the model's equilibrium properties under immune absent, induced, and constitutive assumptions.

text: What was demonstrated in deriving the equation for R 0?	labels:  invasion threshold is elevated at high values of constitutive antiviral acquisition,	episode_done:True
text: What is a conclusion of the modeling?	labels: Constitutive immune processes can thus prohibit pathogen invasion, while induced responses, by definition, can only control infections post-hoc.	episode_done:True
text: What is a conclusion of the study?	labels: Regardless of mechanism (induced or constitutive), interferon-stimulated antiviral cells appear to play a key role in maintaining longer term or persistent infections by safeguarding susceptible cells from rapid infection and concomitant cell death. 	episode_done:True
text: What do  fits to rVSV-MARV infections on PaKiT01 cells suggest?	labels: that the constitutive IFN-a expression characteristic of P. alecto cells may represent more of a constitutive immune priming process than a perpetual, functional, antiviral defense.	episode_done:True
text: What do the findings indicate?	labels: enhanced IFN-mediated immune pathways in bat reservoirs may promote elevated within-host virus replication rates prior to cross-species emergence. 	episode_done:True
text: What is presented in this study?	labels: general methods to study cross-scale viral dynamics, which suggest that within-host persistence is supported by robust antiviral responses characteristic of bat immune processes. 	episode_done:True
text: What is a conclusion of  this study?	labels:  Viruses which evolve rapid replication rates under these robust antiviral defenses may pose the greatest hazard for cross-species pathogen emergence into spillover hosts with immune systems that differ from those unique to bats. 	episode_done:True

text: Where do the respiratory viruses primarily infect and replicate?	labels: within airway epithelial cells 	episode_done:True
text: What happens  during the replication process?	labels: the cells release antiviral factors and cytokines that alter local airway inflammation and airway niche 	episode_done:True
text: What does the inflammation lead to in healthy airways?	labels: leads to type 1 inflammatory responses consisting of activation of an antiviral state and infiltration of antiviral effector cells. This eventually results in the resolution of the inflammatory response and clearance of the viral infection 	episode_done:True
text: How may the responses be different in a chronically inflamed airway?	labels:  the responses against the virus may be impaired or aberrant, causing sustained inflammation and erroneous infiltration, resulting in the exacerbation of their symptoms (Mallia and Johnston, 2006; Dougherty and Fahy, 2009; Busse et al., 2010; Britto et al., 2017; Linden et al., 2019) . This is usually further compounded by the increased susceptibility of chronic airway inflammatory disease patients toward viral respiratory infections, thereby increasing the frequency of exacerbation as a whole	episode_done:True

text: What is the effect of these factors?	labels: These factors heighten local inflammation and the infiltration of granulocytes, T-cells and B-cells (Wark and Gibson, 2006; Braciale et al., 2012) . The increased inflammation, in turn, worsens the symptoms of airway diseases.	episode_done:True
text: What additional effects are caused  in patients with asthma and patients with CRS with nasal polyp ?	labels: viral infections such as RV and RSV promote a Type 2-biased immune response (Becker, 2006; Jackson et al., 2014; Jurak et al., 2018) . This amplifies the basal type 2 inflammation resulting in a greater release of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, RANTES and eotaxin and a further increase in eosinophilia, a key pathological driver of asthma and CRSwNP	episode_done:True
text: What is the result of increased eosinophilia?	labels: worsens the classical symptoms of disease and may further lead to life-threatening conditions due to breathing difficulties	episode_done:True
text: What are the effects for patients with COPD and patients with CRS without nasal polyp (CRSsNP) ?	labels: are more neutrophilic in nature due to the expression of neutrophil chemoattractants such as CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 (Cukic et al., 2012; Brightling and Greening, 2019) . The pathology of these airway diseases is characterized by airway remodeling due to the presence of remodeling factors such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) released from infiltrating neutrophils (Linden et al., 2019) .

text: What  happens in the case of COPD?	labels:  increased ILC2 activation, which retain the capability of differentiating to ILC1, may also further augment the neutrophilic response and further aggravate the exacerbation	episode_done:True
text: What happens during viral infection of healthy individuals?	labels:  these factors are not released to any great extent and do not activate an ILC2 response during viral infection in healthy individuals (Yan et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2018a) ; despite augmenting a type 2 exacerbation in chronically inflamed airways (Jurak et al., 2018) . These classical mechanisms of viral induced acute exacerbations are summarized in Figure 1 	episode_done:True
text: What happens upon viral infection in the airway?	labels: antiviral state will be activated to clear the invading pathogen from the airway. Immune response and injury factors released from the infected epithelium normally would induce a rapid type 1 immunity that facilitates viral clearance. 	episode_done:True
text: What is the effect of the inflammation of the airway?	labels:  However, in the inflamed airway, the cytokines and chemokines released instead augmented the inflammation present in the chronically inflamed airway, strengthening the neutrophilic infiltration in COPD airway, and eosinophilic infiltration in the asthmatic airway.

text: Where is this  especially evident?	labels: in weak type 1 inflammation-inducing viruses such as RV and RSV	episode_done:True
text: What are other  effects?	labels: there are also evidence of reduced type I (IFNβ) and III (IFNλ) interferon production due to type 2-skewed inflammation, which contributes to imperfect clearance of the virus resulting in persistence of viral components, or the live virus in the airway epithelium 	episode_done:True
text: What is the  effect of viral components remaining in the airway?	labels: antiviral genes such as type I interferons, inflammasome activating factors and cytokines remained activated resulting in prolong airway inflammation	episode_done:True

text: What  may the destruction of the epithelial barrier  cause?	labels:  further contact with other pathogens and allergens in the airway which may then prolong exacerbations or results in new exacerbations.	episode_done:True
text: What may the epithelial destruction cause?	labels: may also promote further epithelial remodeling during its regeneration as viral infection induces the expression of remodeling genes such as MMPs and growth factors .

text: How is 2019-nCOV transmitted?	labels: 2019-nCoV was transmitted through respiratory tract and then induced pneumonia,	episode_done:True
text: What are ways in  which 2019-nCOV is transmitted?	labels: We found the presence of 2019-nCoV in anal swabs and blood as well, and more anal swab positives than oral swab positives in a later stage of infection, suggesting shedding and thereby transmitted through oral–fecal route.	episode_done:True
text: Is oral swab for detecting 2019-nCOV infection, sufficient?	labels: the current strategy for the detection of viral RNA in oral swabs used for 2019-nCoV diagnosis is not perfect. The virus may be present in anal swabs or blood of patients when oral swabs detection negative.	episode_done:True
text: Is oral swab for detecting 2019-nCOV infection, sufficient?	labels:  patients infected with 2019-nCoV may harbour the virus in the intestine at the early or late stage of disease. It is also worth to note none of the patients with viremia blood had positive swabs. These patients would likely be considered as 2019-nCoV negative through routine surveillance, and thus pose a threat to other people.	episode_done:True
text: What other tests should be considered for 2019-nCOV epidemiology?	labels: serology should be considered for 2019-nCoV epidemiology.	episode_done:True
text: What tests should  be done before a 2019-nCOV infected patient is discharged?	labels: we cannot discharge a patient purely based on oral swabs negative, who may still shed the virus by oral-fecal route. Above all, we strongly suggest using viral IgM and IgG serological test to confirm an infection, considering the unreliable results from oral swabs detection	episode_done:True

text: What were the surveillance objectives?	labels: to: describe the key epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 cases detected in Europe; inform country preparedness; and improve further case detection and management. 	episode_done:True
text: What is the adopted WHO case definition?	labels: a confirmed case was a person with laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection (ECDC recommended two separate SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests), irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms, whereas a probable case was a suspect case for whom testing for SARS-CoV-2 was inconclusive or positive using a pan-coronavirus assay	episode_done:True
text: When was the first reported death in France?	labels: 15 February	episode_done:True
text: What is the presumed incubation period?	labels:  up to 14 days [	episode_done:True

text: How many cases were hospitalised?	labels: All but two cases were hospitalised (35 of 37 where information on hospitalisation was reported)	episode_done:True
text: Why were they hospitalised?	labels:  it is likely that most were hospitalised to isolate the person rather than because of severe disease. 	episode_done:True
text: What was time from onset to hospitalisation?	labels: ranged between 0 and 10 days with a mean of 3.7 days 	episode_done:True
text: What was the duration of hospitalisation?	labels: The mean number of days to hospitalisation was 2.5 days for cases imported from China, but 4.6 days for those infected in Europe.	episode_done:True
text: Why was this?	labels: This was mostly a result of delays in identifying the index cases of the two clusters in France and Germany. In the German cluster, for example, the first three cases detected locally were hospitalised in a mean of 5.7 days, whereas the following six took only a mean of 2 days to be hospitalised.	episode_done:True
text: How many cases reported symptoms at this point? 	labels:  31 cases	episode_done:True

text: How many reported viral pneumonia?	labels: two reported in Italy and two reported in France	episode_done:True
text: What was the clinical evolution of the hospitalised cases?	labels: All hospitalised cases had a benign clinical evolution except four,	episode_done:True
text: What happened to three cases who were aged 65 years or over?	labels: were admitted to intensive care and required respiratory support and one French case died.	episode_done:True
text: What happened to the case who died?	labels: was hospitalised for 21 days and required intensive care and mechanical ventilation for 19 days	episode_done:True
text: What was the duration of hospitalisation reported for 16 cases ?	labels: a median of 13 days (range: 8-23 days)	episode_done:True
text: How were the assays confirmed?	labels: according to specific assays targeting at least two separate genes (envelope (E) gene as a screening test and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene or nucleoprotein (N) gene for confirmation) 	episode_done:True
text: What were the specimen types for 21 cases?	labels: 15 had positive nasopharyngeal swabs, nine had positive throat swabs, three cases had positive sputum, two had a positive nasal swab, one case had a positive nasopharyngeal aspirate and one a positive endotracheal aspirate.	episode_done:True
text: As of 5 March 2020, what  are the cases in the WHO European region?	labels: there are 4,250 cases including 113 deaths reported among 38 countries	episode_done:True
text: What were the two contexts for transmission?	labels: sporadic cases among travellers from China (14 cases) and cases who acquired infection due to subsequent local transmission in Europe (21 cases).	episode_done:True
text: What  does the analysis show on the difference between locally acquired cases vs imported cases?	labels: that the time from symptom onset to hospitalisation/case isolation was about 3 days longer for locally acquired cases than for imported cases.	episode_done:True
text: What is required for locally acquired cases?	labels: significant resources for contact tracing and quarantine, and countries should be prepared to allocate considerable public health resources during the containment phase, should local clusters emerge in their population. In addition, prompt sharing of information on cases and contacts through international notification systems such as the International Health Regulations (IHR) mechanism and the European Commission's European Early Warning and Response System is essential to contain international spread of infection. 	episode_done:True
text: What was common to all imported cases?	labels: had a history of travel to China	episode_done:True
text: What testing and detection are needed?	labels: Testing of suspected cases based on geographical risk of importation needs to be complemented with additional approaches to ensure early detection of local circulation of COVID-19, including through testing of severe acute respiratory infections in hospitals irrespectively of travel history as recommended in the WHO case definition updated on 27 February 2020 	episode_done:True
text: What did the finding prompt ECDC to do?	labels: include fever among several clinical signs or symptoms indicative for the suspected case definition.	episode_done:True
text: Why is understanding the infection-severity  critical ?	labels: to help plan for the impact on the healthcare system and the wider population.	episode_done:True
text: Why are serological tests vital?	labels: to understand the proportion of cases who are asymptomatic.	episode_done:True
text: How can hospital based surveillance help?	labels: help estimate the incidence of severe cases and identify risk factors for severity and death	episode_done:True
text: How can present systems of surveillance be used?	labels: Established hospital surveillance systems that are in place for influenza and other diseases in Europe may be expanded for this purpose. In addition, a number of countries in Europe are adapting and, in some cases, already using existing sentinel primary care based surveillance systems for influenza to detect community transmission of SARS-CoV-2	episode_done:True
text: How will  this approach used?	labels: will be used globally to help identify evidence of widespread community transmission and, should the virus spread and containment no longer be deemed feasible, to monitor intensity of disease transmission, trends and its geographical spread.	episode_done:True
text: Why is additional research needed?	labels:  to complement surveillance data to build knowledge on the infectious period, modes of transmission, basic and effective reproduction numbers, and effectiveness of prevention and case management options also in settings outside of China.	episode_done:True

text: How much  have  the number of biomedical research publications targeting 'translational' concepts has increased ?	labels: exponentially, up 1800%	episode_done:True
text: What ways to  solve the issues are outlined?	labels: by creatively leveraging the so-called 'strengths' of viruses. Viral RNA polymerisation and reverse transcription enable resistance to treatment by conferring extraordinary genetic diversity. 	episode_done:True
text: How do these exact processes ultimately restrict viral infectivity?	labels:  by strongly limiting virus genome sizes and their incorporation of new information. 	episode_done:True
text: What does the author coin this evolutionary dilemma as?	labels: 'information economy paradox'.	episode_done:True
text: How do many viruses resolve this ?	labels: by manipulating multifunctional or multitasking host cell proteins (MMHPs), thereby maximising host subversion and viral infectivity at minimal informational cost.	episode_done:True
text: How may this "Achilles Heel" be safely targeted?	labels:  via host-oriented therapies to impose devastating informational and fitness barriers on escape mutant selection.	episode_done:True
text: Why  may MMHP-targeting therapies exhibit both robust and broadspectrum antiviral efficacy?	labels: since MMHPs are often conserved targets within and between virus families,	episode_done:True

text: What are Furin, along with other PCSK family members implicated in?	labels:  in immune regulation, cancer and the entry, maturation or release of a broad array of evolutionarily diverse viruses including human papillomavirus (HPV), influenza (IAV), Ebola (EboV), dengue (DenV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)	episode_done:True
text: What do Braun and Sauter review?	labels:  the roles of furin in these processes, as well as the history and future of furin-targeting therapeutics.	episode_done:True
text: What dis their recent work reveal?	labels: how two IFN-cinducible factors exhibit broad-spectrum inhibition of IAV, measles (MV), zika (ZikV) and HIV by suppressing furin activity.	episode_done:True
text: What has the increasing abundance of affordable, sensitive, high-throughput genome sequencing technologies  led to?	labels:  a recent boom in metagenomics and the cataloguing of the microbiome of our world.	episode_done:True

text: What is another  case in point?	labels: the ancient lineage of nucleocytosolic large DNA viruses (NCLDVs)	episode_done:True
text: What are the ancient lineage of NCLDVs? 	labels: emerging human pathogens that possess enormous genomes of up to several megabases in size encoding hundreds of proteins with unique and unknown functions.	episode_done:True

text: Which bat virus have been found to be linked with diseases?	labels: potential human infecting HKU-1, 4, 5 and 9 [17, 18] . Recent MERS-CoV infection is another example for severe disease caused by used-to-be-less pathogenic coronaviruses. Shi and colleagues [19] by using NGS have discovered many unknown animal viruses from bat, especially some important paramyxoviruses and reoviruses. Filovirus has also been identified in bat with potential severe outcomes. Lyssaviruses (with many genotypes, including rabies virus) in the Rhabdoviridae family have been linked with severe fatal human cases, even in the developed countries, including Australia, with the bites of bats in the city [20, 21] .	episode_done:True
text: What assay played an important role?	labels: reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)	episode_done:True
text: What was the death toll in the 1918-1919 Spanish Influenza epidemic?	labels: 50 million deaths worldwide	episode_done:True
text: How many people were infected during the 1918 Spanish Influenza epidemic?	labels: An estimated one third of the world’s population (or z500 million persons) were infected and had clinical- ly apparent illnesses	episode_done:True
text: What was the case fatality rate in the 1918 Spanish Influenza epidemic?	labels: Case- fatality rates were >2.5%, compared to <0.1% in other inﬂuenza pandemics	episode_done:True
text: What was the death toll in the 1918-1919 Spanish Influenza epidemic?	labels: Total deaths were estimated at z50 million (577) and were arguably as high as 100 mil- lion 	episode_done:True
text: Are the modern day Influenza viruses related to the 1918 Spanish Influenza virus?	labels:  All inﬂuenza A pandemics since that time, and indeed almost all cases of inﬂuenza A worldwide (except- ing human infections from avian Viruses such as H5N1 and H7N7), have been caused by descendants of the 1918 Virus, including “drifted” H1N1 Viruses and reassorted H2N2 and H3N2 Viruses.	episode_done:True
text: Why is the Spanish Influenza virus the Mother of the modern influenza viruses?	labels: The latter are composed of key genes from the 1918 Virus, updated by subsequently-incor— porated avian inﬂuenza genes that code for novel surface     *Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Rockville, Maryland, USA; and TNational Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA  proteins, making the 1918 Virus indeed the “mother” of all pandemics.	episode_done:True
text: When was it  determined that the 1918  pandemic was caused by the H1N1 Influenza virus?	labels: That question did not begin to be resolved until the 1930s, when closely related inﬂuenza Viruses (now known to be H1N1 Viruses) were isolated, ﬁrst from pigs and shortly thereafter from humans. Seroepidemiologic studies soon linked both of these viruses to the 1918 pandemic	episode_done:True
text: Did the Spanish Influenza or Swine flu or the H1N1 virus disappear in humans for some time?	labels:  descendants of the 1918 Virus still persists enzootically in pigs. They probably also circulated continuously in humans, undergoing gradual antigenic drift and causing annual epidemics, until the 1950s. With the appearance of a new H2N2 pandemic strain in 1957 (“Asian ﬂu”), the direct H1N1 Viral descen- dants 0f the 1918 pandemic strain disappeared from human circulation entirely, although the related lineage persisted enzootically in pigs.	episode_done:True
text: When did the Swine Flu (Spanish Influenza) virus reappear in humans?	labels:  But in 1977, human H1N1 Viruses suddenly “reemerged” from a laboratory freezer (9). They continue to circulate endemically and epidemically.	episode_done:True
text: What descendant  lineages of the swine flu (Spanish Influenza) virus were identified in 2006?	labels:  2 major descendant lineages of the 1918 H1N1 Virus, as well as 2 additional reassortant lineages, persist naturally: a human epidemic/endemic H1N1 line- age, a porcine enzootic H1N1 lineage (so-called classic swine ﬂu), and the reassorted human H3N2 Virus lineage, which like the human H1N1 Virus, has led to a porcine H3N2 lineage.	episode_done:True
text: Are the modern descendant influenza viruses as dangerous as the 1918 parent swine flu (Spanish Influenza) H1N1 virus?	labels: None of these Viral descendants, however, approaches the pathogenicity of the 1918 parent Virus.	episode_done:True
text: How dangerous are the modern H1N1 (swine flu) and the H3N2 (Influenza A) viruses compared  to the 1918 H1N1 (swine flu Spanish Influenza)  viruses?	labels: the human H1N1 and H3N2 lin- eages have both been associated with substantially lower rates ofillness and death than the virus of 1918. In fact, cur- rent H1N1 death rates are even lower than those for H3N2 lineage strains (prevalent from 1968 until the present).	episode_done:True
text: Are the descendant H1N1 strains of the 1918 H1N1 swine flu (Spanish Influenza) virus, still prevalent?	labels: H1N1 Viruses descended from the 1918 strain, as well as  H3N2 Viruses, have now been cocirculating worldwide for 29 years and show little evidence of imminent extinction.	episode_done:True
text: Is the origin and epidemiology of the 1918 swine flu (Spanish Influenza) known?	labels: ongoing studies to map Virulence factors are yielding interesting results. The 1918 sequence data, however, leave unanswered questions about the ori- gin of the Virus (19) and about the epidemiology of the pandemic.	episode_done:True
text: What is the geographical origin of the H1N1 swine flu ?	labels: Historical and epidemiologic data are inade- quate to identify the geographic origin of the Virus (21), and recent phylogenetic analysis of the 1918 Viral genome does not place the Virus in any geographic context	episode_done:True
text: Is the geographical origin of the 1918 H1N1 swine flu known?	labels: Confounding deﬁnite assignment of a geographic point of origin, the 1918 pandemic spread more or less simultaneously in 3 distinct waves during an z12-month period in 191871919, in Europe, Asia, and North America (the ﬁrst wave was best described in the United States in March 1918)	episode_done:True
text: What is an unique feature of the 1918 swine flu?	labels: the simultaneous (or nearly simultaneous) infection of humans and swin	episode_done:True
text: What season or  time of the year do the new strains of influenza emerge?	labels: Historical records since the 16th century suggest that new inﬂuenza pandemics may appear at any time of year, not necessarily in the familiar annual winter patterns of interpandemic years,	episode_done:True
text: Once appeared, when do the influenza like diseases occur in subsequent years?	labels: confronted by the selection pressures of population immu- nity, these pandemic Viruses begin to drift genetically and eventually settle into a pattern of annual epidemic recur- rences caused by the drifted Virus variants.	episode_done:True
text: When did the first wave of the H1N1 swine flu (Spanish Influenza) occur?	labels:  a ﬁrst or spring wave began in March 1918 and spread unevenly through the United States, Europe, and possibly Asia over the next 6 months	episode_done:True
text: What was the death rate in the first wave of the 1918 swine flu pandemic?	labels:  Illness rates were high, but death rates in most locales were not appreciably above normal.	episode_done:True
text: When were the second and the third wave of the 1918-1919 swine flu pandemic?	labels:  A sec- ond or fall wave spread globally from September to November 1918 and was highly fatal. In many nations, a third wave occurred in early 1919 	episode_done:True
text: What was the primary difference between the first wave and the 2nd and 3rd wave of the 1918-1919 swine flu pandemic?	labels: the much higher fre- quency of complicated, severe, and fatal cases in the last 2 waves.	episode_done:True
text: Why the human influenza viruses do not disappear after herd immunity is developed?	labels: The occurrence, and to some extent the severity, of recur- rent annual outbreaks, are driven by Viral antigenic drift, with an antigenic variant Virus emerging to become domi- nant	episode_done:True
text: What are the circumstances that promote the spread of influenza virus?	labels:  lower environ- mental temperatures and human nasal temperatures (bene- ﬁcial to thermolabile Viruses such as inﬂuenza), optimal humidity, increased crowding indoors, and imperfect ven- tilation due to closed windows and suboptimal airﬂow	episode_done:True
text: Do seasonal temperatures and humidity explain  the appearance of the three waves of the 1918 swine flu?	labels: such factors cannot explain the 3 pandemic waves of 1918-1919, which occurred in the spring-sum- mer, summer—fall, and winter (of the Northern Hemisphere), respectively. The ﬁrst 2 waves occurred at a time of year normally unfavorable to inﬂuenza Virus spread. The second wave caused simultaneous outbreaks in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres from September to November. 	episode_done:True
