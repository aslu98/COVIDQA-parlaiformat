text: How did  the SARS-CoV gain elevated replication and lung pathogenesis in aged mice ?	labels: due to six coding genetic mutations associated with mouse adaptation. 	episode_done:True
text: Why is it likely that MA15 is highly attenuated to  replicate in human cells?	labels: due to the mouse adaptation.	episode_done:True
text: Why were civets proposed to be an intermediate host of the bat-CoVs, capable of spreading SARS CoV to humans?	labels: t was proposed that the S gene from bat-derived CoV, unlike that from human patients-or civetsderived viruses, was unable to use human ACE2 as a receptor for entry into human cells 	episode_done:True

While SL-SHC014-MA15 can replicate efficiently in young and aged mouse lungs, infection was attenuated, and less virus antigen was present in the airway epithelium as compared to SARS MA15, which causes lethal outcomes in aged mice	episode_done:True
text: Why were experiments with SL-SHC014-MA15 chimeric virus were later restricted?	labels: as gain of function (GOF) studies under the US government-mandated pause policy 	episode_done:True

text: What is the difference between evolution and synthetic constructs?	labels: Evolution is stepwise and accrues mutations gradually over time, whereas synthetic constructs would typically use a known backbone and introduce logical or targeted changes instead of the randomly occurring mutations that are present in naturally isolated viruses such as bat CoV RaTG13.	episode_done:True
text: What is the conclusion of this report?	labels:  there is currently no credible evidence to support the claim that SARS-CoV-2 originated from a laboratory-engineered CoV.

text: What can be a factor in using common vectors for the delivery of vaccines?	labels: commonly employed vectors, for example Salmonella and adenovirus, often have pre-existing immune responses in the host and this has the potential to modify the subsequent immune response to a vectored antigen. 	episode_done:True
text: Is a pre-existing immune response to commonly used delivery vector an advantage or a disadvantage?	labels: for bacterial vectors there can in fact, in some cases, be an enhancement in immunogenicity, typically humoral, while for viral vectors pre-existing immunity is a hindrance for subsequent induction of cell-mediated responses.	episode_done:True

text: What is the advantage of Listeria as a  delivery vector for vaccines?	labels: The advantages of Listeria are that it can invade a variety of cells, including antigen presenting cells (APCs). After invading the host cell, Listeria resides inside the phagosome; however, it can escape the phagosome with the help of listeriolysin O (LLO; Hly) and reside in the cytoplasm of the cells, thereby efficiently presenting antigen to both CD8 and CD4 T cells 	episode_done:True

text: What is the connection between chicken and Salmonella?	labels: Chickens (Gallus gallus) are a natural animal reservoir for Salmonella, which makes them an important source of Salmonella-associated gastroenteritis in humans. 	episode_done:True
text: Why are some poxvirus  ideally suited as vaccine delivery vectors?	labels: They are ideal candidate vectors due to their large DNA-packing capacity and their thermal and genetic stability 	episode_done:True
text: What is the advantage of adenovirus as vaccine delivery vector?	labels: adenovirus (Ad) vector is another of the most widely evaluated vectors to date to express heterologous antigens, due to ease of production, safety profile, genetic stability, the ease of DNA genome manipulation, and the ability to stimulate both innate and adaptive immune responses and induce both T and B cell responses 	episode_done:True
text: What are important criteria for selecting vaccine delivery vectors?	labels: a vaccine should be inexpensive, so that it can be administered to a large population at minimal cost	episode_done:True
text: What are important criteria for selecting vaccine delivery vectors?	labels: Safety is a major concern, as even a low level of toxicity is unacceptable 	episode_done:True
text: What are important criteria for selecting vaccine delivery vectors?	labels: long-lasting cellular and (where appropriate) humoral immune responses to the vectored antigen must be induced following administration of these vaccines, preferably with a single dose	episode_done:True
text: What happens when a recipient of a vaccine has immune response to the delivery vector?	labels: considering a vector such as Salmonella, if a host has previously been infected there will exist robust B and T memory responses, and as such, when a vaccination is delivered, an anamnestic response to the Salmonella antigens will be induced (while the response to the vectored antigen will be a primary response)	episode_done:True
text: What is the effect of host immune response to the delivery vector on the efficacy of vaccination?	labels: for virally vectored antigens, the existence of pre-existing immunity to the vector (particularly neutralizing antibody) will restrict delivery of the virus into cells, thereby effectively reducing the dose of the vectored antigen. Again, this might be expected to result in a reduction in the antigenicity of the vectored antigen.	episode_done:True
text: What is the effect of host immune response to the delivery vector on the efficacy of vaccination?	labels: theoretically reduce the exposure of the heterologous antigen to the immune system, as the vector is rapidly cleared.	episode_done:True
text: What is an example  of the effect of immunity to the  delivery vector on the efficacy of vaccination?	labels: mice that had been primed with Salmonella alone, and then boosted with Salmonella expressing tetC, induced much lower anti-tetC responses than mice that had not been primed. This argues strongly that prior immunological immunity to the vector can seriously dampen subsequent antigen-specific humoral responses.	episode_done:True
text: What is the effect of host immune response to viral delivery vectors in the efficacy of vaccination?	labels: pre-existing immunity is a major obstacle of many viralvectored vaccines, such as Ad serotype 5 or herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), where the rate of seroprevalence to these viruses is very high [40-45 % and 70 % (or more) of the US population, respectively] 	episode_done:True
text: What is the effect of host immune response to  the viral delivery vector on the efficacy of vaccination?	labels: Vector-specific antibodies may impede the induction of immune responses to the vaccine-encoded antigens, as they may reduce the dose and time of exposure of the target cells to the vaccinated antigens	episode_done:True
text: What is the effect of host immune response to the delivery vector on  the efficacy of vaccination?	labels:  In a large-scale clinical trial (STEP) of an Ad serotype 5 (AdHu5)-based HIV-1 vaccine, the vaccines showed a lack of efficacy and tended to increase the risk of HIV-1 infection in vaccine recipients who had pre-existing neutralizing antibodies to AdHu5 (	episode_done:True
text: What are methods to avoid the effect vector immunity on the efficacy of vaccination?	labels:  the use of vectors derived from nonhuman sources, using human viruses of rare serotypes (Kahl et al., 2010; Lasaro & Ertl, 2009) , heterologous prime-boost approaches (Liu et al., 2008) , homologous reimmunization (Steffensen et al., 2012) and removing key neutralizing epitopes on the surface of viral capsid proteins (Gabitzsch & Jones, 2011; Roberts et al., 2006) 	episode_done:True
text: What are methods to  avoid the effect of vector immune response on the efficacy of vaccination?	labels: The inhibitory effect of pre-existing immunity can also be avoided by masking the Ad vector inside dendritic cells (DCs) (Steffensen et al., 2012) . In addition, mucosal vaccination or administration of higher vaccine doses can overcome pre-existing immunity problems (Alexander et al., 2012; Belyakov et al., 1999; Priddy et al., 2008; Xiang et al., 2003) . 	episode_done:True
text: How does cell-mediated immunity to viral delivery vector, reduce the immune response to vaccine?	labels:  this is because viruses will induce neutralizing antibody on the first dose, and in subsequent doses this antibody will limit the number of transduced cells, therefore limiting the responses. This is particularly a problem with a common viral vector such as Ad, where a large proportion of the population will have immunological memory against common serotypes	episode_done:True
text: How can vectors for which host has immunity, be used differently to increase the efficacy of vaccination?	labels:  it will be possible to utilize such vectors only by developing vaccines from alternative serotypes. It may be that a vector such as Pre-existing immunity against vaccine vectors attenuated influenza virus, with the ability to easily develop reassortants, will be useful in this context.  In addition, immunological memory in the form of opsonizing antibody certainly plays an important role in the early uptake of Salmonella by macrophages and DC. This may be beneficial, as the live bacterial vector used for delivery purposes harbours mutations in genes encoding proteins responsible for their survival in the animal host. This not only encumbers their ability to cause disease, making them safe live vectors, but also limits the number of replications. The presence of opsonizing antibodies should mean a higher level of bacterial uptake, leading to higher presentation to the immune system and therefore a better immune response.	episode_done:True
