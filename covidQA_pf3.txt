text: Why would real  case fatality rate for the H7N9 be lower than detected rate?	labels: most people usually think a common cold is a very common and normal occurrence, and they don't take flu-like illnesses seriously. In most situations, they would just stay home and take some medicines. Only those who have very severe flu-like symptoms would see doctors, and thereby be detected and diagnosed, accordingly the real case fatality rate should be much lower	episode_done:True

text: Should I practice social distancing?	labels: Together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19 by making a conscious effort to keep a physical distance between each other. Physical (social) distancing is proven to be one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of illness during an outbreak. This means making changes in your everyday routines to minimize close contact with others, including:avoiding crowded places and non-essential gatherings avoiding common greetings, such as handshakes limiting contact with people at higher risk like older adults and those in poor health keeping a distance of at least 2 arms-length (approximately 2 metres) from others	episode_done:True
text: Should I practice social distancing?	labels: Staying at least six feet (2 meters) from other people can help reduce the spread. But this does not mean for sure that you will not get the virus.	episode_done:True
text: Should I practice social distancing?	labels: If you are having symptoms of COVID-19, call your health care provider to be tested. If you do not have a health care provider, call 2-1-1 to be connected with a local community or hospital-connected clinic for referral to a test site. Health care providers are encouraged to order a test for any child or adult who is showing symptoms of COVID-19, even if their symptoms are mild.	episode_done:True
text: Should I practice social distancing?	labels: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others. If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time. That is because there are not enough of these masks for health care workers. Health care workers need these masks to stay safe and to take care of sick patients. If you have extra surgical or N95 masks, please donate them to your local healthcare facility.	episode_done:True
text: Should I practice social distancing?	labels: Social distancing means maintaining a physical distance (approximately 6 feet or 2 meters) from others you do not live with. This includes when you're inside a store or outside for exercise. The COVID-19 virus spreads easily from person-to-person. It travels through the air when a sick person coughs, sneezes or talks. One way to contain the spread of COVID-19 is to stop people from sharing it. Without a vaccine or treatment, we can help contain the virus by: Staying at home to protect others if you are sick. Staying home is still the best way to lower our risk of COVID-19, but small groups of 10 or fewer people are now allowed if health and safety precautions are followed. Learn how to safely connect with friends and family. Continuing to go outside, take walks, do essential errands while maintaining a physical distance from others and practicing proper hygiene. Remember that ticks are active this time of year. Find out how to Be Tick Smart and prevent tick bites. Wearing a cloth face mask or covering in public settings when a physical distance of at least 6 feet is difficult to maintain, especially at the grocery store, pharmacy, doctorâs office, hospital or other essential business or office, and on a crowded sidewalk or bike path. Washing your hands (adults and children) any time you go inside, before you eat, and before you spend time with people who are more vulnerable to the effects of COVID-19.	episode_done:True
text: Someone from quarantaine came to my office and stayed 20min Is it a risk?	labels: Most people who get COVID-19 will be able to recover at home.

text: Someone from quarantaine came to my office and stayed 20min Is it a risk?	labels: You could be at higher risk of catching COVID-19 if many people have gotten COVID-19 near where you live. You could also have a higher risk if you visit places where many people are getting sick with COVID-19.Right now, in most places, the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. But this is changing quickly in many cities and areas around the world.	episode_done:True
text: Someone from quarantaine came to my office and stayed 20min Is it a risk?	labels: You can reduce your risk of getting sick by:1. Staying at home as much as you can. Only go out when you really need to (for groceries, for example) 2. If you do go out, keep at least 6 foot (2 meter) distance between you and other people. 3. Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, sneezing, using the restroom, coming home and before eating or makng food. ALWAYS wash your hands with soap and water if your hands are visibly dirty.4. If you don't have soap and water, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that has at least 60% alcohol. 5. Clean and disinfect surfaces that people touch a lot (e.g. tables, countertops, light switches, door knobs, cabinet handles). If you or someone in your family gets sick, stay at home, except when getting medical care, until your doctor says you no longer have to stay home. Cover your coughs and sneezes with tissues, and throw the tissue away.	episode_done:True
text: Someone from quarantaine came to my office and stayed 20min Is it a risk?	labels: Generally, do not touch the body of someone who has died of COVID-19. We are still learning how COVID-19 spreads and if a deceased body can transmit the virus. One could get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it, and then touching their face (like their mouth, nose, or eyes). Try to avoid kissing washing, and shrouding the body. If washing and shrouding the body are important in your culture or religion, work with your community cultural and religious leaders as well as funeral home staff to try to reduce exposure as much as possible. People who conduct these activities should wear disposable gloves. If fluid splashing is expected, more personal protective equipment may be needed, such as disposable gowns, goggles, and face masks.	episode_done:True

text: What are the symptoms Is vomiting one of them?	labels: Those who are infected with COVID-19 may have little to no symptoms. You may not know you have symptoms of COVID-19 because they are similar to a cold or flu. Symptoms haveincluded:cough fever difficulty breathing pneumonia in both lungsIn severe cases, infection can leadto death.Symptoms may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to COVID-19. This is the longest known incubation period for this disease.Recent evidence indicates that the virus can be transmitted to othersfrom someone who is infected but not showing symptoms. This includes peoplewho:have not yet developed symptoms (pre-symptomatic) never develop symptoms (asymptomatic)While experts know that these kinds of transmissions are happening amongthose in close contact or in close physical settings, it is not known to whatextent. This means it is extremely important to follow the proven preventative measures.Think you might have COVID-19? Take a self-assessment	episode_done:True
text: What are the symptoms Is vomiting one of them?	labels: The time between exposure to the COVID-19 virus and onset of symptoms is called the “incubation period.” The incubation period for COVID-19 is typically 2 to 14 days, although in some cases it may be longer.	episode_done:True
text: What are the symptoms Is vomiting one of them?	labels: Children and adults have the same COVID-19 symptoms, although children might not get as sick as adults. Children might get a fever, runny nose, or cough. Some children have had vomiting or diarrhea. We are still learning about how COVID-19 affects children.	episode_done:True
text: What are the symptoms Is vomiting one of them?	labels: People might be able to spread the disease before people realize they are sick. But most scientists think that people are most likely to infect others when they have symptoms and feel sick.

text: What are the symptoms Is vomiting one of them?	labels: Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. There are different types of coronaviruses.Some types of coronavirus are more common in people and some versions are more common in animals. Rarely, a type of the virus that was common in animals can spread to people. "Coronavirus Disease 2019” (which is shortened to "COVID-19") is an example of a type of coronavirus that has recently spread to humans.	episode_done:True
text: Should I stay home?	labels: Staying at home and using "social distancing" helps stop the virus from spreading quickly. This helps to reduce the burden on healthcare systems, as there are not enough hospital workers and beds if too many people get sick at once.Social distancing means staying farther away from other people and avoiding groups of people. Since COVID-19 mostly spreads from person-to-person interactions, staying at least 6 feet away from other people can help stop the spread. It is important to use social distancing because people can spread COVID-19 even if they feel fine. It is especially important to use social distancing to protect people who are more likely to get very sick from the disease.	episode_done:True
text: Should I stay home?	labels: If you are having symptoms of COVID-19, call your health care provider to be tested. If you do not have a health care provider, call 2-1-1 to be connected with a local community or hospital-connected clinic for referral to a test site. Health care providers are encouraged to order a test for any child or adult who is showing symptoms of COVID-19, even if their symptoms are mild.	episode_done:True
text: Should I stay home?	labels: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others. If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time. That is because there are not enough of these masks for health care workers. Health care workers need these masks to stay safe and to take care of sick patients. If you have extra surgical or N95 masks, please donate them to your local healthcare facility.	episode_done:True
text: Should I stay home?	labels: If you do not have any symptoms, you will be asked to:1. Self-quarantine for 14 days after you get home.2.

If you experience a medical emergency such as trouble breathing, call 911 and let the operator know you may have COVID-19. For severe illness, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.  Currently there are no FDA-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of COVID-19. Researchers are studying new drugs, and drugs that are already approved for other health conditions, as possible treatments for COVID-19. The FDA is working with drug manufacturers, researchers, and other partners to accelerate the development process for COVID-19 treatments. CDC has more information for health care providers about these potential treatments. Never take a prescription medicine or drug if it is not prescribed for you by your doctor for your health condition.	episode_done:True
text: How do I treat coronavirus?	labels: In the lab, these drugs have been shown to prevent the growth of the virus that causes COVID-19. There are a few reports of patients with COVID-19 who received these drugs and improved. Some are reports of groups of patients, all of whom received the drug. It is not known whether it was the drug that led to the improvement or whether there were other factors involved. We do not know if the treated patients’ condition would have improved without the drug. To know this, there would have to be a group of similar patients who did not receive the drug (control). Because chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine may possibly help very sick patients, FDA is allowing these drugs to be provided to certain hospitalized patients under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) issued March 28, 2020.  Under the EUA, health care providers and patients are provided with information about the risks of these drugs. However, more data from clinical trials are necessary for us to determine whether chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate are safe and effective in treating or preventing COVID-19.	episode_done:True

It helps to stop the virus from spreading quickly. This also helps to prevent there being too many sick people for hospitals to handle.	episode_done:True
text: I have Hashimoto s hypothyroiditis Am I more at risk I also had a PE due to Fv leiden and oral contraceptives in 2001 what do you recommend I do?	labels: Staying at home and using "social distancing" helps stop the virus from spreading quickly. This helps to reduce the burden on healthcare systems, as there are not enough hospital workers and beds if too many people get sick at once.Social distancing means staying farther away from other people and avoiding groups of people. Since COVID-19 mostly spreads from person-to-person interactions, staying at least 6 feet away from other people can help stop the spread. It is important to use social distancing because people can spread COVID-19 even if they feel fine. It is especially important to use social distancing to protect people who are more likely to get very sick from the disease.	episode_done:True
text: How does COVID 19 affect asymptomatic people s lungs?	labels: COVID-19 can spread in a few different ways. It can spread from person to person if you inhale an infected person's respiratory droplets when they sneezes, coughs, or talk. It can also spead if you touch something that an infected person has touched, like a door knob, elevator button, or bathroom faucet.That's why it's important to wash your hands, avoid touching your face, and practice social distancing to avoid getting sick. That's why it's also important to self-isolate and wear a mask around other household members if you are sick to avoid infecting other people.	episode_done:True
text: How does COVID 19 affect asymptomatic people s lungs?	labels: People can fight stigma by providing social support in situations where you notice this is occurring. Stigma affects the emotional or  mental health  of stigmatized groups and the communities they live in. Stopping stigma is important to making communities and community members resilient. See  resources on mental health and coping during COVID-19 . Everyone can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by  knowing the facts  and sharing them with others in your community.	episode_done:True
text: How does COVID 19 affect asymptomatic people s lungs?	labels: In the lab, these drugs have been shown to prevent the growth of the virus that causes COVID-19. There are a few reports of patients with COVID-19 who received these drugs and improved. Some are reports of groups of patients, all of whom received the drug. It is not known whether it was the drug that led to the improvement or whether there were other factors involved. We do not know if the treated patients’ condition would have improved without the drug. To know this, there would have to be a group of similar patients who did not receive the drug (control). Because chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine may possibly help very sick patients, FDA is allowing these drugs to be provided to certain hospitalized patients under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) issued March 28, 2020.  Under the EUA, health care providers and patients are provided with information about the risks of these drugs. However, more data from clinical trials are necessary for us to determine whether chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate are safe and effective in treating or preventing COVID-19.	episode_done:True
text: How does COVID 19 affect asymptomatic people s lungs?	labels: Together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19 by making a conscious effort to keep a physical distance between each other. Physical (social) distancing is proven to be one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of illness during an outbreak. This means making changes in your everyday routines to minimize close contact with others, including:avoiding crowded places and non-essential gatherings avoiding common greetings, such as handshakes limiting contact with people at higher risk like older adults and those in poor health keeping a distance of at least 2 arms-length (approximately 2 metres) from others	episode_done:True

text: what are the symptoms of covid 19 by day of infection?	labels: SARS-COV-2 is the name for the virus that causes the disease known as "COVID-19." Let's break it down."SARS" stands for "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome", meaning that it can cause serious problems with breathing and the lungs."COV" stands for "Coronavirus." This is the type of virus that causes COVID-19. The "2" is a way to say that this virus is different than the SARS virus that caused an outbreak in 2002-2003.	episode_done:True
text: what are the symptoms of covid 19 by day of infection?	labels: People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. People with mild symptoms are able to recover at home. If you experience a medical emergency such as trouble breathing, call 911 and let the operator know you may have COVID-19. For severe illness, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.  Currently there are no FDA-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of COVID-19. Researchers are studying new drugs, and drugs that are already approved for other health conditions, as possible treatments for COVID-19. The FDA is working with drug manufacturers, researchers, and other partners to accelerate the development process for COVID-19 treatments. CDC has more information for health care providers about these potential treatments. Never take a prescription medicine or drug if it is not prescribed for you by your doctor for your health condition.	episode_done:True
text: How long does the virus remain on a surface?	labels: Current thinking is that COVID-19 mostly spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets. But some studies show that the virus can last on surfaces, so it is possible that someone could get the virus by touching a surface that has the virus on it and then touching their mouth, nose, or eyes.	episode_done:True
text: How long does the virus remain on a surface?	labels: A recent study shows that the virus can live in the air and on surfaces from several hours to several days. On plastic, it can live for up to 72 hours (3 days). On stainless steel, it can live for up to 48 hours (2 days). On cardboard, it can live up to 24 hours (1 day). On copper, it can live up to four hours. It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID-19 from these surfaces.  It is still important to regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces as well as packages and mail that come through. Remember to wash your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol based hand sanitizer (60%).	episode_done:True
text: How long does the virus remain on a surface?	labels: How long you should be isolated for varies on a case-by-case basis.

Health care providers are encouraged to order a test for any child or adult who is showing symptoms of COVID-19, even if their symptoms are mild.	episode_done:True
text: Should I use NSAIDs?	labels: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others. If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time.

text: Is it true that you can get the virus again even after you ve recovered?	labels: Social distancing means maintaining a physical distance (approximately 6 feet or 2 meters) from others you do not live with. This includes when you're inside a store or outside for exercise. The COVID-19 virus spreads easily from person-to-person. It travels through the air when a sick person coughs, sneezes or talks. One way to contain the spread of COVID-19 is to stop people from sharing it. Without a vaccine or treatment, we can help contain the virus by: Staying at home to protect others if you are sick. Staying home is still the best way to lower our risk of COVID-19, but small groups of 10 or fewer people are now allowed if health and safety precautions are followed. Learn how to safely connect with friends and family. Continuing to go outside, take walks, do essential errands while maintaining a physical distance from others and practicing proper hygiene. Remember that ticks are active this time of year. Find out how to Be Tick Smart and prevent tick bites. Wearing a cloth face mask or covering in public settings when a physical distance of at least 6 feet is difficult to maintain, especially at the grocery store, pharmacy, doctorâs office, hospital or other essential business or office, and on a crowded sidewalk or bike path. Washing your hands (adults and children) any time you go inside, before you eat, and before you spend time with people who are more vulnerable to the effects of COVID-19.	episode_done:True

text: Is it true that you can get the virus again even after you ve recovered?	labels: ​Currently, there is no evidence that COVID-19 can spread through contact with imported goods. There have been no cases of COVID-19 in the United States associated with imported goods. Other coronaviruses do not survive well on surfaces. So, experts think the risk of spread from products or packages shipped over days or weeks is extremely low. Coronaviruses spread most often by small droplets of mucus from the nose and throat.	episode_done:True
text: Is it true that you can get the virus again even after you ve recovered?	labels: If you are having symptoms of COVID-19, call your health care provider for a referral. If you do not have a health care provider, call 2-1-1 to be connected with a local community or hospital-connected clinic for a referral to a test site. If you are having a medical emergency, call 9-1-1 or go to the hospital. Health care providers are encouraged to order a test for any child or adult who is showing symptoms of COVID-19, even if their symptoms are mild. Find out what to do if you are sick from the CDC and what to do while youâre waiting for test results. Pop-up Testing Sites Any Vermonter without symptoms can be tested at a pop-up testing site without a doctorâs referral. This includes people who work in Vermont, second homeowners, and college students. Registration for testing is required. For people who do not have internet access and want to register at a pop-up site, they can call 2-1-1 for help with registration. Register for a pop-up testing site. The test is a nasopharyngeal swab, or NP swab, where a health care professional uses a swab to collect a sample from the back of the nose and throat. This test will tell you if you have a current infection. It is not a serology/antibody test, which means it will not tell you if you were infected in the past. The following groups are encouraged to get tested at pop-up sites: health care workers, first responders (EMS, fire, and law enforcement), child care providers currently serving essential workers, and anyone currently under quarantine who has had no symptoms during the first seven days of quarantine.

text: Do I need a mask?	labels: Staying at home and using "social distancing" helps stop the virus from spreading quickly. This helps to reduce the burden on healthcare systems, as there are not enough hospital workers and beds if too many people get sick at once.Social distancing means staying farther away from other people and avoiding groups of people. Since COVID-19 mostly spreads from person-to-person interactions, staying at least 6 feet away from other people can help stop the spread. It is important to use social distancing because people can spread COVID-19 even if they feel fine. It is especially important to use social distancing to protect people who are more likely to get very sick from the disease.	episode_done:True
text: How long will social distancing measures last?	labels: Together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19 by making a conscious effort to keep a physical distance between each other. Physical (social) distancing is proven to be one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of illness during an outbreak. This means making changes in your everyday routines to minimize close contact with others, including:avoiding crowded places and non-essential gatherings avoiding common greetings, such as handshakes limiting contact with people at higher risk like older adults and those in poor health keeping a distance of at least 2 arms-length (approximately 2 metres) from others	episode_done:True
text: How long will social distancing measures last?	labels: Social distancing means maintaining a physical distance (approximately 6 feet or 2 meters) from others you do not live with. This includes when you're inside a store or outside for exercise. The COVID-19 virus spreads easily from person-to-person. It travels through the air when a sick person coughs, sneezes or talks. One way to contain the spread of COVID-19 is to stop people from sharing it. Without a vaccine or treatment, we can help contain the virus by: Staying at home to protect others if you are sick. Staying home is still the best way to lower our risk of COVID-19, but small groups of 10 or fewer people are now allowed if health and safety precautions are followed. Learn how to safely connect with friends and family. Continuing to go outside, take walks, do essential errands while maintaining a physical distance from others and practicing proper hygiene. Remember that ticks are active this time of year. Find out how to Be Tick Smart and prevent tick bites. Wearing a cloth face mask or covering in public settings when a physical distance of at least 6 feet is difficult to maintain, especially at the grocery store, pharmacy, doctorâs office, hospital or other essential business or office, and on a crowded sidewalk or bike path.

text: How long will social distancing measures last?	labels: How long you should be isolated for varies on a case-by-case basis. If you have been sick with COVID-19 and have been in isolation, you should talk to your healthcare provider to decide when you can be released from isolation. Your doctor will look for signs that:-You are fever-free without taking fever-reducing medication -You no longer show symptoms -Sometimes, your doctor might recommend testing respiratory samples to decide if you can be released from isolationOnce you have been released from isolation, then you are no longer considered to be likely to infect other people.	episode_done:True
text: How long will social distancing measures last?	labels: A recent study shows that the virus can live in the air and on surfaces from several hours to several days. On plastic, it can live for up to 72 hours (3 days). On stainless steel, it can live for up to 48 hours (2 days). On cardboard, it can live up to 24 hours (1 day). On copper, it can live up to four hours. It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID-19 from these surfaces.  It is still important to regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces as well as packages and mail that come through. Remember to wash your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol based hand sanitizer (60%).	episode_done:True

It helps to stop the virus from spreading quickly. This also helps to prevent there being too many sick people for hospitals to handle.	episode_done:True
text: If I traveled from Vancouver to quebec city do i need to quaratine?	labels: Staying at home and using "social distancing" helps stop the virus from spreading quickly. This helps to reduce the burden on healthcare systems, as there are not enough hospital workers and beds if too many people get sick at once.Social distancing means staying farther away from other people and avoiding groups of people. Since COVID-19 mostly spreads from person-to-person interactions, staying at least 6 feet away from other people can help stop the spread. It is important to use social distancing because people can spread COVID-19 even if they feel fine. It is especially important to use social distancing to protect people who are more likely to get very sick from the disease.	episode_done:True

Symptoms haveincluded:cough fever difficulty breathing pneumonia in both lungsIn severe cases, infection can leadto death.Symptoms may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to COVID-19. This is the longest known incubation period for this disease.Recent evidence indicates that the virus can be transmitted to othersfrom someone who is infected but not showing symptoms. This includes peoplewho:have not yet developed symptoms (pre-symptomatic) never develop symptoms (asymptomatic)While experts know that these kinds of transmissions are happening amongthose in close contact or in close physical settings, it is not known to whatextent.

text: what are cov19 symptoms?	labels: Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. There are different types of coronaviruses.Some types of coronavirus are more common in people and some versions are more common in animals. Rarely, a type of the virus that was common in animals can spread to people. "Coronavirus Disease 2019” (which is shortened to "COVID-19") is an example of a type of coronavirus that has recently spread to humans.	episode_done:True
text: what are cov19 symptoms?	labels: COVID-19 is a disease caused by a new type of virus. Sometimes people also call it "coronavirus," which is is the type of virus that causes COVID-19. COVID-19 causes some symptoms that are like getting a cold or flu. But some people get worse symptoms and need more care. COVID-19 is caused by a new type of virus that our body has not seen before.

text: If you recover from the virus can you still be a carrier?	labels: ​Currently, there is no evidence that COVID-19 can spread through contact with imported goods. There have been no cases of COVID-19 in the United States associated with imported goods. Other coronaviruses do not survive well on surfaces. So, experts think the risk of spread from products or packages shipped over days or weeks is extremely low. Coronaviruses spread most often by small droplets of mucus from the nose and throat.	episode_done:True
text: If you recover from the virus can you still be a carrier?	labels: If you don't have access to hand sanitizer, soap and water are always the best option.Make sure any hand santizer you have has at least 60% alcohol, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Any hand sanitizer that has less than 60% alcohol will not be effective at killing the virus.	episode_done:True
text: If you recover from the virus can you still be a carrier?	labels: You can protect your child by having them wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and avoid people who are sick. They should also stay away from people outside your home. This means you should avoid playdates, playing on public playgrounds, or being physically close to friends.You should also clean and disinfect surfaces that you touch a lot in household common areas like tables, chairs, and doorknobs. Wash clothes and plush toys frequently.	episode_done:True
text: If you recover from the virus can you still be a carrier?	labels: Right now, we don't know of any clear cases of the virus passing from people to their pets. There was a tiger in a zoo in New York City that seems to have gotten COVID-19 from its caretakers. To be safe, wash your hands before and after touching animals. Until we know more, if you have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and have a pet or other animal, you should:1. Avoid close contact with them. Do not snuggle or kiss them, let them lick you, sit on your lap, or sleep in your bed. 2. Avoid coughing and sneezing on your animals. Cover your coughs and sneezes. 3. Have another member of your household care for your animals, if you can. 4. If it's not possible to have someone else care for your animal, always wash your hands before touching or feeding them. 5. Limit your animal's contact with other people and animals. Tthis may mean keeping them indoors.We might learn more about human to animal spread in the future.

text: If I contract the virus does wearing a mask prevent others getting infected?	labels: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others. If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time.

text: How contagious is the virus?	labels: COVID-19 is contagious and it is actively spreading from person to person. The CDC recommends that those who have COVID-19 are isolated either at a hospital or at home, depending on how sick they are, until they are no longer at risk of infecting others.	episode_done:True
text: How contagious is the virus?	labels: A recent study shows that the virus can live in the air and on surfaces from several hours to several days. On plastic, it can live for up to 72 hours (3 days). On stainless steel, it can live for up to 48 hours (2 days). On cardboard, it can live up to 24 hours (1 day). On copper, it can live up to four hours. It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID-19 from these surfaces.  It is still important to regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces as well as packages and mail that come through. Remember to wash your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol based hand sanitizer (60%).	episode_done:True

This is the type of virus that causes COVID-19. The "2" is a way to say that this virus is different than the SARS virus that caused an outbreak in 2002-2003.	episode_done:True
text: What are the symptoms for COVID 19?	labels: People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. People with mild symptoms are able to recover at home. If you experience a medical emergency such as trouble breathing, call 911 and let the operator know you may have COVID-19. For severe illness, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.  Currently there are no FDA-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of COVID-19. Researchers are studying new drugs, and drugs that are already approved for other health conditions, as possible treatments for COVID-19. The FDA is working with drug manufacturers, researchers, and other partners to accelerate the development process for COVID-19 treatments. CDC has more information for health care providers about these potential treatments. Never take a prescription medicine or drug if it is not prescribed for you by your doctor for your health condition.	episode_done:True

text: What s the difference between COVID 19 and CoronaVirus?	labels: You need to self-isolate if you have been confirmed to have COVID-19. Isolation is a health care term that means keeping infected people away from those who are not infected. If you have been asked to self-isolate, you should:-Stay at home except to get medical care -Stay away from other people in your home as much as you can -Wear a face mask if you need to be around other people (for example, in a doctor's office) -Cover your coughs and sneezes -Wash your hands frequently -Continue to monitor your symptoms until your doctor says you don't need to be in isolation any moreQuarantine means staying away from other people because you might have been exposed to the virus. For COVID-19, people should quarantine for at least 14 days, or 2 weeks from the time they might have had contact with someone with COVID-19. That's because most people who get COVID-19 would have symptoms within 14 days. Scientists think that people are not likely to spread COVID-19 to others if they do not get sick after 14 days.	episode_done:True
text: What s the difference between COVID 19 and CoronaVirus?	labels: The difference between self-monitoring and self-isolation is based on whether you have been diagnosed with COVID-19 or not. If you may have been exposed to COVID-19 but don't have symptoms, you should self-monitor. If you have been diagnosed with COVID-19, you should self-isolate.You need to self-monitor if you have no symptoms but may have been exposed to COVID-19 in the last 14 days or are in close contact with older adults, people who are medically vulnerable or have been asked to do so by your Public Health Authority. Self-monitoring means you should:-Monitor yourself for 14 days for symptoms like fever, cough, and trouble breathing -Stay at home -Avoid crowded places -Stay at least 6 feet away from others as much as you can -Wash your hands frequentlyYou need to self-isolate if you have been confirmed to have COVID-19. Isolation means keeping infected people away from those who are not infected. If you have been asked to self-isolate, you should:-Stay home except to get medical care -Stay away from other people in your home as much as you can -Wear a face mask if you need to be around other people (for example, in a doctor's office) -Cover your coughs and sneezes -Wash your hands frequently -Keep checking your symptoms until your doctor says you don't need to be in isolation any more	episode_done:True
text: What s the difference between COVID 19 and CoronaVirus?	labels: COVID-19 is a disease caused by a new type of virus. Sometimes people also call it "coronavirus," which is is the type of virus that causes COVID-19. COVID-19 causes some symptoms that are like getting a cold or flu. But some people get worse symptoms and need more care. COVID-19 is caused by a new type of virus that our body has not seen before. Since our body has not seen it before, our immune system has to learn how to fight off this new virus.	episode_done:True
text: What s the difference between COVID 19 and CoronaVirus?	labels: SARS-COV-2 is the name for the virus that causes the disease known as "COVID-19." Let's break it down."SARS" stands for "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome", meaning that it can cause serious problems with breathing and the lungs."COV" stands for "Coronavirus." This is the type of virus that causes COVID-19. The "2" is a way to say that this virus is different than the SARS virus that caused an outbreak in 2002-2003.	episode_done:True
text: What are the symptoms?	labels: Those who are infected with COVID-19 may have little to no symptoms. You may not know you have symptoms of COVID-19 because they are similar to a cold or flu. Symptoms haveincluded:cough fever difficulty breathing pneumonia in both lungsIn severe cases, infection can leadto death.Symptoms may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to COVID-19. This is the longest known incubation period for this disease.Recent evidence indicates that the virus can be transmitted to othersfrom someone who is infected but not showing symptoms. This includes peoplewho:have not yet developed symptoms (pre-symptomatic) never develop symptoms (asymptomatic)While experts know that these kinds of transmissions are happening amongthose in close contact or in close physical settings, it is not known to whatextent. This means it is extremely important to follow the proven preventative measures.Think you might have COVID-19? Take a self-assessment	episode_done:True
text: What are the symptoms?	labels: Children and adults have the same COVID-19 symptoms, although children might not get as sick as adults. Children might get a fever, runny nose, or cough. Some children have had vomiting or diarrhea. We are still learning about how COVID-19 affects children.	episode_done:True

text: What are the symptoms?	labels: Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. There are different types of coronaviruses.Some types of coronavirus are more common in people and some versions are more common in animals. Rarely, a type of the virus that was common in animals can spread to people. "Coronavirus Disease 2019” (which is shortened to "COVID-19") is an example of a type of coronavirus that has recently spread to humans.	episode_done:True

text: Is it useful to wear a mask if we are not sick?	labels: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others. If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time. That is because there are not enough of these masks for health care workers. Health care workers need these masks to stay safe and to take care of sick patients. If you have extra surgical or N95 masks, please donate them to your local healthcare facility.	episode_done:True
text: Is it useful to wear a mask if we are not sick?	labels: Children under the age of 2 years should not wear any type of masks. Because babies' airways are smaller, breathing through a mask is even harder on them and they are more likely to suffocate if they use a mask. Older infants or young toddlers are not likely to keep the mask on and will likely try to remove it. This will mean they are touching their face more and could infect themselves with the virus. It is safest to keep children at home and follow social distancing.	episode_done:True
text: Is it useful to wear a mask if we are not sick?	labels: CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public when other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission of the coronavirus. The purpose of wearing cloth face coverings in public is to slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others. Read more about types of face masks and FDA’s emergency use authorization for non-surgical face masks.	episode_done:True

text: Is it useful to wear a mask if we are not sick?	labels: Fewer children seem to get infected by the coronavirus than adults, and most of those who do contract it have mild symptoms, if any.A very small number of children with the virus have shown symptoms associated with toxic shock or Kawasaki disease. This is a rare illness in children, according to the New York City Health Department, that involves inflammation of the blood vessels, including coronary arteries. Two studies conducted in recent weeks offer compelling evidence that children can transmit the virus. While neither proved it, many epidemiologists who were not involved in the research said that the evidence was strong enough to suggest that schools should be kept closed for now.

text: How many cases in Quebec?	labels: COVID-19 can spread in a few different ways. It can spread from person to person if you inhale an infected person's respiratory droplets when they sneezes, coughs, or talk. It can also spead if you touch something that an infected person has touched, like a door knob, elevator button, or bathroom faucet.That's why it's important to wash your hands, avoid touching your face, and practice social distancing to avoid getting sick.

text: How many cases in Quebec?	labels: How long you should be isolated for varies on a case-by-case basis. If you have been sick with COVID-19 and have been in isolation, you should talk to your healthcare provider to decide when you can be released from isolation. Your doctor will look for signs that:-You are fever-free without taking fever-reducing medication -You no longer show symptoms -Sometimes, your doctor might recommend testing respiratory samples to decide if you can be released from isolationOnce you have been released from isolation, then you are no longer considered to be likely to infect other people.	episode_done:True

text: I am coughing but I don t have fever Could I have covid 19?	labels: Generally, do not touch the body of someone who has died of COVID-19. We are still learning how COVID-19 spreads and if a deceased body can transmit the virus. One could get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it, and then touching their face (like their mouth, nose, or eyes). Try to avoid kissing washing, and shrouding the body. If washing and shrouding the body are important in your culture or religion, work with your community cultural and religious leaders as well as funeral home staff to try to reduce exposure as much as possible. People who conduct these activities should wear disposable gloves. If fluid splashing is expected, more personal protective equipment may be needed, such as disposable gowns, goggles, and face masks.	episode_done:True
text: I am coughing but I don t have fever Could I have covid 19?	labels: Pregnant women should do the same things as everyone else to avoid COVID-19 infection, including: Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, you can use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Clean and disinfect frequently-touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash and wash your hands. Stay home when you are sick. When you must go out, practice social distancing.	episode_done:True

text: I am coughing but I don t have fever Could I have covid 19?	labels: Because COVID-19 is a new disease, we are still learning how it affects pregnant women. At this time, there is no evidence to suggest that pregnant women are at a greater risk for more serious outcomes related to COVID-19 or that their developing child could be negatively affected by COVID-19. You can protect yourself from becoming ill by taking the following precautions:stay home as much as possible, except for important medical appointments talk to your doctor, obstetrician or midwife about the possibility of telephone or videoconference appointments avoid unnecessary visitors to your home wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds use alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available practise physical distancing by keeping a distance of at least 2 metres from others avoid touching your mouth, nose and eyes avoid crowded places and peak-hours make limited trips to the store for essentials avoid travel by public transitFor more information, refer to our advice for motherson pregnancy, childbirth and caring for newborns.

text: How long does the virus stay airborne?	labels: A recent study shows that the virus can live in the air and on surfaces from several hours to several days. On plastic, it can live for up to 72 hours (3 days). On stainless steel, it can live for up to 48 hours (2 days). On cardboard, it can live up to 24 hours (1 day). On copper, it can live up to four hours. It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID-19 from these surfaces.  It is still important to regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces as well as packages and mail that come through. Remember to wash your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol based hand sanitizer (60%).	episode_done:True
text: How long does the virus stay airborne?	labels: Staying at home and using "social distancing" helps stop the virus from spreading quickly. This helps to reduce the burden on healthcare systems, as there are not enough hospital workers and beds if too many people get sick at once.Social distancing means staying farther away from other people and avoiding groups of people. Since COVID-19 mostly spreads from person-to-person interactions, staying at least 6 feet away from other people can help stop the spread. It is important to use social distancing because people can spread COVID-19 even if they feel fine. It is especially important to use social distancing to protect people who are more likely to get very sick from the disease.	episode_done:True

Physical (social) distancing is proven to be one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of illness during an outbreak. This means making changes in your everyday routines to minimize close contact with others, including:avoiding crowded places and non-essential gatherings avoiding common greetings, such as handshakes limiting contact with people at higher risk like older adults and those in poor health keeping a distance of at least 2 arms-length (approximately 2 metres) from others	episode_done:True

text: If someone was infected once can they be reinfected Can they still carry the virus and infect others?	labels: Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease. Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure. For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days. Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period.	episode_done:True
text: If someone was infected once can they be reinfected Can they still carry the virus and infect others?	labels: Try to avoid all unnecessary travel at this time. If it is essential to travel, try to avoid contact with sick passengers, mantain as much distance as possible from other passengers, avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. You should also wear a cloth face covering while at the airport and on the plane.	episode_done:True
text: If someone was infected once can they be reinfected Can they still carry the virus and infect others?	labels: Right now, we don't know of any higher risk due to being in the same room at a funeral or visitation service with the body of someone who has died of COVID-19 as long as you stay 6 feet (2 meters) away. That being said, for now we must all avoid large gatherings and stay at home as much as we can to reduce the spread of COVID-19.	episode_done:True

text: What are the symptoms of Covid 19?	labels: Those who are infected with COVID-19 may have little to no symptoms. You may not know you have symptoms of COVID-19 because they are similar to a cold or flu. Symptoms haveincluded:cough fever difficulty breathing pneumonia in both lungsIn severe cases, infection can leadto death.Symptoms may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to COVID-19. This is the longest known incubation period for this disease.Recent evidence indicates that the virus can be transmitted to othersfrom someone who is infected but not showing symptoms. This includes peoplewho:have not yet developed symptoms (pre-symptomatic) never develop symptoms (asymptomatic)While experts know that these kinds of transmissions are happening amongthose in close contact or in close physical settings, it is not known to whatextent. This means it is extremely important to follow the proven preventative measures.Think you might have COVID-19? Take a self-assessment	episode_done:True
text: What are the symptoms of Covid 19?	labels: COVID-19 is a disease caused by a new type of virus. Sometimes people also call it "coronavirus," which is is the type of virus that causes COVID-19. COVID-19 causes some symptoms that are like getting a cold or flu. But some people get worse symptoms and need more care. COVID-19 is caused by a new type of virus that our body has not seen before. Since our body has not seen it before, our immune system has to learn how to fight off this new virus.	episode_done:True
text: What are the symptoms of Covid 19?	labels: Children and adults have the same COVID-19 symptoms, although children might not get as sick as adults. Children might get a fever, runny nose, or cough. Some children have had vomiting or diarrhea. We are still learning about how COVID-19 affects children.	episode_done:True
text: What are the symptoms of Covid 19?	labels: SARS-COV-2 is the name for the virus that causes the disease known as "COVID-19." Let's break it down."SARS" stands for "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome", meaning that it can cause serious problems with breathing and the lungs."COV" stands for "Coronavirus." This is the type of virus that causes COVID-19. The "2" is a way to say that this virus is different than the SARS virus that caused an outbreak in 2002-2003.	episode_done:True
text: What are the symptoms of Covid 19?	labels: People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. People with mild symptoms are able to recover at home. If you experience a medical emergency such as trouble breathing, call 911 and let the operator know you may have COVID-19. For severe illness, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.  Currently there are no FDA-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of COVID-19. Researchers are studying new drugs, and drugs that are already approved for other health conditions, as possible treatments for COVID-19. The FDA is working with drug manufacturers, researchers, and other partners to accelerate the development process for COVID-19 treatments. CDC has more information for health care providers about these potential treatments. Never take a prescription medicine or drug if it is not prescribed for you by your doctor for your health condition.	episode_done:True
text: How does it spread?	labels: COVID-19 can spread in a few different ways. It can spread from person to person if you inhale an infected person's respiratory droplets when they sneezes, coughs, or talk. It can also spead if you touch something that an infected person has touched, like a door knob, elevator button, or bathroom faucet.That's why it's important to wash your hands, avoid touching your face, and practice social distancing to avoid getting sick. That's why it's also important to self-isolate and wear a mask around other household members if you are sick to avoid infecting other people.	episode_done:True
text: How does it spread?	labels: Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.	episode_done:True
text: How does it spread?	labels: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others. If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time. That is because there are not enough of these masks for health care workers. Health care workers need these masks to stay safe and to take care of sick patients. If you have extra surgical or N95 masks, please donate them to your local healthcare facility.	episode_done:True
text: How does it spread?	labels: Current thinking is that COVID-19 mostly spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets. But some studies show that the virus can last on surfaces, so it is possible that someone could get the virus by touching a surface that has the virus on it and then touching their mouth, nose, or eyes.	episode_done:True
text: How does it spread?	labels: Together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19 by making a conscious effort to keep a physical distance between each other. Physical (social) distancing is proven to be one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of illness during an outbreak. This means making changes in your everyday routines to minimize close contact with others, including:avoiding crowded places and non-essential gatherings avoiding common greetings, such as handshakes limiting contact with people at higher risk like older adults and those in poor health keeping a distance of at least 2 arms-length (approximately 2 metres) from others	episode_done:True
text: Where did COVID 19 come from?	labels: COVID-19 is a virus strain, first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, that has only spread in people since December 2019. Health experts are closely monitoring the situation because little is known about this new virus and it has the potential to cause severe illness and pneumonia in some people.	episode_done:True
text: Where did COVID 19 come from?	labels: If you are having symptoms of COVID-19, call your health care provider for a referral. If you do not have a health care provider, call 2-1-1 to be connected with a local community or hospital-connected clinic for a referral to a test site. If you are having a medical emergency, call 9-1-1 or go to the hospital. Health care providers are encouraged to order a test for any child or adult who is showing symptoms of COVID-19, even if their symptoms are mild. Find out what to do if you are sick from the CDC and what to do while youâre waiting for test results. Pop-up Testing Sites Any Vermonter without symptoms can be tested at a pop-up testing site without a doctorâs referral. This includes people who work in Vermont, second homeowners, and college students. Registration for testing is required. For people who do not have internet access and want to register at a pop-up site, they can call 2-1-1 for help with registration. Register for a pop-up testing site. The test is a nasopharyngeal swab, or NP swab, where a health care professional uses a swab to collect a sample from the back of the nose and throat. This test will tell you if you have a current infection. It is not a serology/antibody test, which means it will not tell you if you were infected in the past. The following groups are encouraged to get tested at pop-up sites: health care workers, first responders (EMS, fire, and law enforcement), child care providers currently serving essential workers, and anyone currently under quarantine who has had no symptoms during the first seven days of quarantine. Find more details under âI am under a 14-day quarantine. Can I have the option to be tested and end my quarantine period?â on this page.	episode_done:True
text: Where did COVID 19 come from?	labels: You could be at higher risk of catching COVID-19 if many people have gotten COVID-19 near where you live. You could also have a higher risk if you visit places where many people are getting sick with COVID-19.Right now, in most places, the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low.

On copper, it can live up to four hours. It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID-19 from these surfaces.  It is still important to regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces as well as packages and mail that come through.

If someone has asked you to self-isolate, you should:-Stay at home except to get medical care -Stay away from other people in your home as much as you can -Wear a face mask if you have to be around other people (for example, in a doctor's office) -Cover your coughs and sneezes -Wash your hands a lot -Keep track of your symptomsGo here to read more about how you should self-isolate, visit this page: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html	episode_done:True
text: If I am starting to breath heavily should I get it checked out?	labels: Because COVID-19 is a new disease, we are still learning how it affects pregnant women. At this time, there is no evidence to suggest that pregnant women are at a greater risk for more serious outcomes related to COVID-19 or that their developing child could be negatively affected by COVID-19. You can protect yourself from becoming ill by taking the following precautions:stay home as much as possible, except for important medical appointments talk to your doctor, obstetrician or midwife about the possibility of telephone or videoconference appointments avoid unnecessary visitors to your home wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds use alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available practise physical distancing by keeping a distance of at least 2 metres from others avoid touching your mouth, nose and eyes avoid crowded places and peak-hours make limited trips to the store for essentials avoid travel by public transitFor more information, refer to our advice for motherson pregnancy, childbirth and caring for newborns.

text: If I am starting to breath heavily should I get it checked out?	labels: If you are having symptoms of COVID-19, call your health care provider to be tested. If you do not have a health care provider, call 2-1-1 to be connected with a local community or hospital-connected clinic for referral to a test site. Health care providers are encouraged to order a test for any child or adult who is showing symptoms of COVID-19, even if their symptoms are mild.	episode_done:True
text: If I am starting to breath heavily should I get it checked out?	labels: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others. If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time. That is because there are not enough of these masks for health care workers. Health care workers need these masks to stay safe and to take care of sick patients. If you have extra surgical or N95 masks, please donate them to your local healthcare facility.	episode_done:True
text: If I am starting to breath heavily should I get it checked out?	labels: Pregnant women should do the same things as everyone else to avoid COVID-19 infection, including: Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, you can use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Clean and disinfect frequently-touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash and wash your hands. Stay home when you are sick. When you must go out, practice social distancing.	episode_done:True

One could get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it, and then touching their face (like their mouth, nose, or eyes). Try to avoid kissing washing, and shrouding the body. If washing and shrouding the body are important in your culture or religion, work with your community cultural and religious leaders as well as funeral home staff to try to reduce exposure as much as possible. People who conduct these activities should wear disposable gloves. If fluid splashing is expected, more personal protective equipment may be needed, such as disposable gowns, goggles, and face masks.	episode_done:True
text: how many people have died?	labels: Right now, we don't know of any higher risk due to being in the same room at a funeral or visitation service with the body of someone who has died of COVID-19 as long as you stay 6 feet (2 meters) away.

This helps to reduce the burden on healthcare systems, as there are not enough hospital workers and beds if too many people get sick at once.Social distancing means staying farther away from other people and avoiding groups of people. Since COVID-19 mostly spreads from person-to-person interactions, staying at least 6 feet away from other people can help stop the spread. It is important to use social distancing because people can spread COVID-19 even if they feel fine. It is especially important to use social distancing to protect people who are more likely to get very sick from the disease.	episode_done:True

At this time, there is no evidence to suggest that pregnant women are at a greater risk for more serious outcomes related to COVID-19 or that their developing child could be negatively affected by COVID-19. You can protect yourself from becoming ill by taking the following precautions:stay home as much as possible, except for important medical appointments talk to your doctor, obstetrician or midwife about the possibility of telephone or videoconference appointments avoid unnecessary visitors to your home wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds use alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available practise physical distancing by keeping a distance of at least 2 metres from others avoid touching your mouth, nose and eyes avoid crowded places and peak-hours make limited trips to the store for essentials avoid travel by public transitFor more information, refer to our advice for motherson pregnancy, childbirth and caring for newborns. If you are pregnant and concerned about COVID-19, speak to your health care provider.	episode_done:True
text: I am 43 What s the chance of my survival if I get covid?	labels: Pregnant women should do the same things as everyone else to avoid COVID-19 infection, including: Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, you can use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Clean and disinfect frequently-touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash and wash your hands. Stay home when you are sick. When you must go out, practice social distancing.	episode_done:True

text: I am 43 What s the chance of my survival if I get covid?	labels: Travellers should adhere to strict hygiene measures, wash hands with soap and water regularly, and/or use alcohol-based hand sanitisers. Touching the face with unwashed hands should be avoided. Travellers should avoid contact with sick persons, in particular those with respiratory symptoms and fever. It should be emphasised that older people and those with underlying health conditions should take these precautionary measures very seriously. Travellers who develop any symptoms during or after travel should self-isolate; those developing acute respiratory symptoms within 14 days upon return should be advised to seek immediate medical advice, ideally by phone first to their national healthcare provider.	episode_done:True
text: I am 43 What s the chance of my survival if I get covid?	labels: If you are having symptoms of COVID-19, call your health care provider for a referral. If you do not have a health care provider, call 2-1-1 to be connected with a local community or hospital-connected clinic for a referral to a test site. If you are having a medical emergency, call 9-1-1 or go to the hospital. Health care providers are encouraged to order a test for any child or adult who is showing symptoms of COVID-19, even if their symptoms are mild. Find out what to do if you are sick from the CDC and what to do while youâre waiting for test results. Pop-up Testing Sites Any Vermonter without symptoms can be tested at a pop-up testing site without a doctorâs referral. This includes people who work in Vermont, second homeowners, and college students. Registration for testing is required. For people who do not have internet access and want to register at a pop-up site, they can call 2-1-1 for help with registration. Register for a pop-up testing site. The test is a nasopharyngeal swab, or NP swab, where a health care professional uses a swab to collect a sample from the back of the nose and throat. This test will tell you if you have a current infection. It is not a serology/antibody test, which means it will not tell you if you were infected in the past. The following groups are encouraged to get tested at pop-up sites: health care workers, first responders (EMS, fire, and law enforcement), child care providers currently serving essential workers, and anyone currently under quarantine who has had no symptoms during the first seven days of quarantine. Find more details under âI am under a 14-day quarantine. Can I have the option to be tested and end my quarantine period?â on this page.	episode_done:True
text: Do I have to wear gloves and mask?	labels: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others. If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time. That is because there are not enough of these masks for health care workers. Health care workers need these masks to stay safe and to take care of sick patients. If you have extra surgical or N95 masks, please donate them to your local healthcare facility.	episode_done:True

text: Do I have to wear gloves and mask?	labels: Staying at home and using "social distancing" helps stop the virus from spreading quickly. This helps to reduce the burden on healthcare systems, as there are not enough hospital workers and beds if too many people get sick at once.Social distancing means staying farther away from other people and avoiding groups of people. Since COVID-19 mostly spreads from person-to-person interactions, staying at least 6 feet away from other people can help stop the spread. It is important to use social distancing because people can spread COVID-19 even if they feel fine. It is especially important to use social distancing to protect people who are more likely to get very sick from the disease.	episode_done:True
text: Do I have to wear gloves and mask?	labels: Children under the age of 2 years should not wear any type of masks. Because babies' airways are smaller, breathing through a mask is even harder on them and they are more likely to suffocate if they use a mask. Older infants or young toddlers are not likely to keep the mask on and will likely try to remove it. This will mean they are touching their face more and could infect themselves with the virus. It is safest to keep children at home and follow social distancing.	episode_done:True

text: How much longer will society need to socially isolate?	labels: Social distancing means maintaining a physical distance (approximately 6 feet or 2 meters) from others you do not live with. This includes when you're inside a store or outside for exercise. The COVID-19 virus spreads easily from person-to-person. It travels through the air when a sick person coughs, sneezes or talks. One way to contain the spread of COVID-19 is to stop people from sharing it. Without a vaccine or treatment, we can help contain the virus by: Staying at home to protect others if you are sick. Staying home is still the best way to lower our risk of COVID-19, but small groups of 10 or fewer people are now allowed if health and safety precautions are followed. Learn how to safely connect with friends and family. Continuing to go outside, take walks, do essential errands while maintaining a physical distance from others and practicing proper hygiene. Remember that ticks are active this time of year. Find out how to Be Tick Smart and prevent tick bites. Wearing a cloth face mask or covering in public settings when a physical distance of at least 6 feet is difficult to maintain, especially at the grocery store, pharmacy, doctorâs office, hospital or other essential business or office, and on a crowded sidewalk or bike path.

text: What are the side effects of hydroxychloroquine for treating COVID 19?	labels: In the lab, these drugs have been shown to prevent the growth of the virus that causes COVID-19. There are a few reports of patients with COVID-19 who received these drugs and improved. Some are reports of groups of patients, all of whom received the drug. It is not known whether it was the drug that led to the improvement or whether there were other factors involved. We do not know if the treated patients’ condition would have improved without the drug. To know this, there would have to be a group of similar patients who did not receive the drug (control). Because chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine may possibly help very sick patients, FDA is allowing these drugs to be provided to certain hospitalized patients under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) issued March 28, 2020.  Under the EUA, health care providers and patients are provided with information about the risks of these drugs. However, more data from clinical trials are necessary for us to determine whether chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate are safe and effective in treating or preventing COVID-19.	episode_done:True

text: What are the side effects of hydroxychloroquine for treating COVID 19?	labels: People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. People with mild symptoms are able to recover at home. If you experience a medical emergency such as trouble breathing, call 911 and let the operator know you may have COVID-19. For severe illness, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.  Currently there are no FDA-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of COVID-19. Researchers are studying new drugs, and drugs that are already approved for other health conditions, as possible treatments for COVID-19. The FDA is working with drug manufacturers, researchers, and other partners to accelerate the development process for COVID-19 treatments. CDC has more information for health care providers about these potential treatments. Never take a prescription medicine or drug if it is not prescribed for you by your doctor for your health condition.	episode_done:True

Since COVID-19 mostly spreads from person-to-person interactions, staying at least 6 feet away from other people can help stop the spread. It is important to use social distancing because people can spread COVID-19 even if they feel fine.

text: How is the corona virus being spread?	labels: COVID-19 can spread in a few different ways. It can spread from person to person if you inhale an infected person's respiratory droplets when they sneezes, coughs, or talk. It can also spead if you touch something that an infected person has touched, like a door knob, elevator button, or bathroom faucet.That's why it's important to wash your hands, avoid touching your face, and practice social distancing to avoid getting sick. That's why it's also important to self-isolate and wear a mask around other household members if you are sick to avoid infecting other people.	episode_done:True

text: How is the corona virus being spread?	labels: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others. If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time. That is because there are not enough of these masks for health care workers. Health care workers need these masks to stay safe and to take care of sick patients. If you have extra surgical or N95 masks, please donate them to your local healthcare facility.	episode_done:True
text: How is the corona virus being spread?	labels: Current thinking is that COVID-19 mostly spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets. But some studies show that the virus can last on surfaces, so it is possible that someone could get the virus by touching a surface that has the virus on it and then touching their mouth, nose, or eyes.	episode_done:True
text: How is the corona virus being spread?	labels: COVID-19 is contagious and it is actively spreading from person to person. The CDC recommends that those who have COVID-19 are isolated either at a hospital or at home, depending on how sick they are, until they are no longer at risk of infecting others.	episode_done:True
text: How long does the virus stay on surfaces?	labels: A recent study shows that the virus can live in the air and on surfaces from several hours to several days. On plastic, it can live for up to 72 hours (3 days). On stainless steel, it can live for up to 48 hours (2 days). On cardboard, it can live up to 24 hours (1 day). On copper, it can live up to four hours. It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID-19 from these surfaces.  It is still important to regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces as well as packages and mail that come through. Remember to wash your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol based hand sanitizer (60%).	episode_done:True

text: How long does the virus stay on surfaces?	labels: Together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19 by making a conscious effort to keep a physical distance between each other. Physical (social) distancing is proven to be one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of illness during an outbreak. This means making changes in your everyday routines to minimize close contact with others, including:avoiding crowded places and non-essential gatherings avoiding common greetings, such as handshakes limiting contact with people at higher risk like older adults and those in poor health keeping a distance of at least 2 arms-length (approximately 2 metres) from others	episode_done:True

text: Can the Covid survive in the air?	labels: If you are having symptoms of COVID-19, call your health care provider for a referral. If you do not have a health care provider, call 2-1-1 to be connected with a local community or hospital-connected clinic for a referral to a test site. If you are having a medical emergency, call 9-1-1 or go to the hospital. Health care providers are encouraged to order a test for any child or adult who is showing symptoms of COVID-19, even if their symptoms are mild. Find out what to do if you are sick from the CDC and what to do while youâre waiting for test results. Pop-up Testing Sites Any Vermonter without symptoms can be tested at a pop-up testing site without a doctorâs referral. This includes people who work in Vermont, second homeowners, and college students. Registration for testing is required. For people who do not have internet access and want to register at a pop-up site, they can call 2-1-1 for help with registration. Register for a pop-up testing site. The test is a nasopharyngeal swab, or NP swab, where a health care professional uses a swab to collect a sample from the back of the nose and throat. This test will tell you if you have a current infection. It is not a serology/antibody test, which means it will not tell you if you were infected in the past. The following groups are encouraged to get tested at pop-up sites: health care workers, first responders (EMS, fire, and law enforcement), child care providers currently serving essential workers, and anyone currently under quarantine who has had no symptoms during the first seven days of quarantine. Find more details under âI am under a 14-day quarantine. Can I have the option to be tested and end my quarantine period?â on this page.	episode_done:True
text: Can the Covid survive in the air?	labels: Fewer children seem to get infected by the coronavirus than adults, and most of those who do contract it have mild symptoms, if any.A very small number of children with the virus have shown symptoms associated with toxic shock or Kawasaki disease. This is a rare illness in children, according to the New York City Health Department, that involves inflammation of the blood vessels, including coronary arteries. Two studies conducted in recent weeks offer compelling evidence that children can transmit the virus. While neither proved it, many epidemiologists who were not involved in the research said that the evidence was strong enough to suggest that schools should be kept closed for now.

text: Does COVID 19 spread by means of gametes?	labels: In the lab, these drugs have been shown to prevent the growth of the virus that causes COVID-19. There are a few reports of patients with COVID-19 who received these drugs and improved. Some are reports of groups of patients, all of whom received the drug. It is not known whether it was the drug that led to the improvement or whether there were other factors involved. We do not know if the treated patients’ condition would have improved without the drug. To know this, there would have to be a group of similar patients who did not receive the drug (control). Because chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine may possibly help very sick patients, FDA is allowing these drugs to be provided to certain hospitalized patients under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) issued March 28, 2020.  Under the EUA, health care providers and patients are provided with information about the risks of these drugs. However, more data from clinical trials are necessary for us to determine whether chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate are safe and effective in treating or preventing COVID-19.	episode_done:True

text: Does COVID 19 spread by means of gametes?	labels: Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease. Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure. For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days. Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period.	episode_done:True

text: What is the estimated population that will be infected by the covid 19 virus?	labels: People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. People with mild symptoms are able to recover at home. If you experience a medical emergency such as trouble breathing, call 911 and let the operator know you may have COVID-19. For severe illness, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.  Currently there are no FDA-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of COVID-19. Researchers are studying new drugs, and drugs that are already approved for other health conditions, as possible treatments for COVID-19. The FDA is working with drug manufacturers, researchers, and other partners to accelerate the development process for COVID-19 treatments. CDC has more information for health care providers about these potential treatments.

text: Can you see friends if you stick to the social distancing guidelines?	labels: Together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19 by making a conscious effort to keep a physical distance between each other. Physical (social) distancing is proven to be one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of illness during an outbreak. This means making changes in your everyday routines to minimize close contact with others, including:avoiding crowded places and non-essential gatherings avoiding common greetings, such as handshakes limiting contact with people at higher risk like older adults and those in poor health keeping a distance of at least 2 arms-length (approximately 2 metres) from others	episode_done:True
text: Can you see friends if you stick to the social distancing guidelines?	labels: Social distancing means maintaining a physical distance (approximately 6 feet or 2 meters) from others you do not live with. This includes when you're inside a store or outside for exercise. The COVID-19 virus spreads easily from person-to-person. It travels through the air when a sick person coughs, sneezes or talks. One way to contain the spread of COVID-19 is to stop people from sharing it. Without a vaccine or treatment, we can help contain the virus by: Staying at home to protect others if you are sick. Staying home is still the best way to lower our risk of COVID-19, but small groups of 10 or fewer people are now allowed if health and safety precautions are followed. Learn how to safely connect with friends and family. Continuing to go outside, take walks, do essential errands while maintaining a physical distance from others and practicing proper hygiene.

text: When having covid 19 What are the next possible symptoms for a 4 years old child?	labels: Fewer children seem to get infected by the coronavirus than adults, and most of those who do contract it have mild symptoms, if any.A very small number of children with the virus have shown symptoms associated with toxic shock or Kawasaki disease. This is a rare illness in children, according to the New York City Health Department, that involves inflammation of the blood vessels, including coronary arteries. Two studies conducted in recent weeks offer compelling evidence that children can transmit the virus. While neither proved it, many epidemiologists who were not involved in the research said that the evidence was strong enough to suggest that schools should be kept closed for now.

text: How does COVID 19 spread?	labels: In the lab, these drugs have been shown to prevent the growth of the virus that causes COVID-19. There are a few reports of patients with COVID-19 who received these drugs and improved. Some are reports of groups of patients, all of whom received the drug. It is not known whether it was the drug that led to the improvement or whether there were other factors involved. We do not know if the treated patients’ condition would have improved without the drug. To know this, there would have to be a group of similar patients who did not receive the drug (control). Because chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine may possibly help very sick patients, FDA is allowing these drugs to be provided to certain hospitalized patients under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) issued March 28, 2020.  Under the EUA, health care providers and patients are provided with information about the risks of these drugs.

Since our body has not seen it before, our immune system has to learn how to fight off this new virus.	episode_done:True
text: what are the symptoms of covid 19?	labels: Children and adults have the same COVID-19 symptoms, although children might not get as sick as adults. Children might get a fever, runny nose, or cough. Some children have had vomiting or diarrhea. We are still learning about how COVID-19 affects children.	episode_done:True
text: what are the symptoms of covid 19?	labels: SARS-COV-2 is the name for the virus that causes the disease known as "COVID-19." Let's break it down."SARS" stands for "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome", meaning that it can cause serious problems with breathing and the lungs."COV" stands for "Coronavirus." This is the type of virus that causes COVID-19. The "2" is a way to say that this virus is different than the SARS virus that caused an outbreak in 2002-2003.	episode_done:True
text: what are the symptoms of covid 19?	labels: People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. People with mild symptoms are able to recover at home. If you experience a medical emergency such as trouble breathing, call 911 and let the operator know you may have COVID-19. For severe illness, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.  Currently there are no FDA-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of COVID-19. Researchers are studying new drugs, and drugs that are already approved for other health conditions, as possible treatments for COVID-19. The FDA is working with drug manufacturers, researchers, and other partners to accelerate the development process for COVID-19 treatments. CDC has more information for health care providers about these potential treatments. Never take a prescription medicine or drug if it is not prescribed for you by your doctor for your health condition.	episode_done:True

text: how to protect from Covid19?	labels: You can protect your child by having them wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and avoid people who are sick. They should also stay away from people outside your home. This means you should avoid playdates, playing on public playgrounds, or being physically close to friends.You should also clean and disinfect surfaces that you touch a lot in household common areas like tables, chairs, and doorknobs.

text: What are the symptoms?	labels: Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. There are different types of coronaviruses.Some types of coronavirus are more common in people and some versions are more common in animals.

text: Can I get the virus from a stray cat?	labels: Preliminary findings from limited laboratory experimental studies indicate that, of species tested thus far, cats are the species most susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2. Some cats in these studies developed signs of clinical disease. Ferrets were also found to be susceptible to infection, but appeared less likely to develop disease. In the laboratory setting cats and ferrets were also able to transmit SARS-CoV-2 to other cats and ferrets, respectively. Golden Syrian hamsters were also able to be experimentally infected and were able to spread the infection to other hamsters. Dogs appeared to be susceptible to infection, but less so than cats or ferrets. Other preliminary laboratory findings indicate that poultry and pigs are not susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2.It is important to understand that experimentally induced infection does not mirror naturally induced infection. In other words, just because an animal can be experimentally infected via inoculation with high concentrations of purified tissue-cultured virus does not mean that it will be easily be infected with that same virus under natural conditions. The number of animals involved in these studies was also very small and conclusions were drawn based on data that, in some cases, were collected from as few as two animals. There is no evidence to suggest that animals, including pets, that may be incidentally infected by humans are playing a role in the spread of COVID-19. Human outbreaks are driven by person-to-person transmission.	episode_done:True
text: Can I get the virus from a stray cat?	labels: Right now, COVID-19 mostly spreads from person to person. But experts agree that the virus likely came from bats and may have passed through another type of animal in China before spreading to people. If you are going to travel, check the latest health notices for up-to-date advice before you leave. Avoid contact with animals, including wild meat and live animal markets.Animal importers, rescues, and adoptive families should limit or postpone importing animals from affected areas. If animals are imported from an affected area, monitor them closely for illness. Call a veterinarian if they get sick and call before bringing them to the office so that they can prepare.	episode_done:True
text: Can I get the virus from a stray cat?	labels: If you are having symptoms of COVID-19, call your health care provider for a referral. If you do not have a health care provider, call 2-1-1 to be connected with a local community or hospital-connected clinic for a referral to a test site. If you are having a medical emergency, call 9-1-1 or go to the hospital. Health care providers are encouraged to order a test for any child or adult who is showing symptoms of COVID-19, even if their symptoms are mild. Find out what to do if you are sick from the CDC and what to do while youâre waiting for test results. Pop-up Testing Sites Any Vermonter without symptoms can be tested at a pop-up testing site without a doctorâs referral. This includes people who work in Vermont, second homeowners, and college students. Registration for testing is required. For people who do not have internet access and want to register at a pop-up site, they can call 2-1-1 for help with registration. Register for a pop-up testing site. The test is a nasopharyngeal swab, or NP swab, where a health care professional uses a swab to collect a sample from the back of the nose and throat. This test will tell you if you have a current infection. It is not a serology/antibody test, which means it will not tell you if you were infected in the past. The following groups are encouraged to get tested at pop-up sites: health care workers, first responders (EMS, fire, and law enforcement), child care providers currently serving essential workers, and anyone currently under quarantine who has had no symptoms during the first seven days of quarantine.

text: Can I get the virus from a stray cat?	labels: Right now, we don't know of any clear cases of the virus passing from people to their pets. There was a tiger in a zoo in New York City that seems to have gotten COVID-19 from its caretakers. To be safe, wash your hands before and after touching animals. Until we know more, if you have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and have a pet or other animal, you should:1. Avoid close contact with them. Do not snuggle or kiss them, let them lick you, sit on your lap, or sleep in your bed. 2. Avoid coughing and sneezing on your animals. Cover your coughs and sneezes. 3. Have another member of your household care for your animals, if you can. 4. If it's not possible to have someone else care for your animal, always wash your hands before touching or feeding them. 5. Limit your animal's contact with other people and animals. Tthis may mean keeping them indoors.We might learn more about human to animal spread in the future.

text: How long does the virus survive on a surface like a doorknob?	labels: A recent study shows that the virus can live in the air and on surfaces from several hours to several days. On plastic, it can live for up to 72 hours (3 days). On stainless steel, it can live for up to 48 hours (2 days). On cardboard, it can live up to 24 hours (1 day). On copper, it can live up to four hours. It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID-19 from these surfaces.  It is still important to regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces as well as packages and mail that come through. Remember to wash your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol based hand sanitizer (60%).	episode_done:True
text: How long does the virus survive on a surface like a doorknob?	labels: Current thinking is that COVID-19 mostly spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets.

text: How long does the virus survive on a surface like a doorknob?	labels: How long you should be isolated for varies on a case-by-case basis. If you have been sick with COVID-19 and have been in isolation, you should talk to your healthcare provider to decide when you can be released from isolation. Your doctor will look for signs that:-You are fever-free without taking fever-reducing medication -You no longer show symptoms -Sometimes, your doctor might recommend testing respiratory samples to decide if you can be released from isolationOnce you have been released from isolation, then you are no longer considered to be likely to infect other people.	episode_done:True
text: How long does the virus survive on a surface like a doorknob?	labels: COVID-19 can spread in a few different ways.

text: How long does the virus survive on a surface like a doorknob?	labels: Together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19 by making a conscious effort to keep a physical distance between each other. Physical (social) distancing is proven to be one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of illness during an outbreak. This means making changes in your everyday routines to minimize close contact with others, including:avoiding crowded places and non-essential gatherings avoiding common greetings, such as handshakes limiting contact with people at higher risk like older adults and those in poor health keeping a distance of at least 2 arms-length (approximately 2 metres) from others	episode_done:True
text: How long does it stays on fabric?	labels: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others.

This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time.

text: does wearing mask protect me from covid 19?	labels: COVID-19 is a virus strain, first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, that has only spread in people since December 2019. Health experts are closely monitoring the situation because little is known about this new virus and it has the potential to cause severe illness and pneumonia in some people.	episode_done:True
text: does wearing mask protect me from covid 19?	labels: COVID-19 can spread in a few different ways. It can spread from person to person if you inhale an infected person's respiratory droplets when they sneezes, coughs, or talk. It can also spead if you touch something that an infected person has touched, like a door knob, elevator button, or bathroom faucet.That's why it's important to wash your hands, avoid touching your face, and practice social distancing to avoid getting sick. That's why it's also important to self-isolate and wear a mask around other household members if you are sick to avoid infecting other people.	episode_done:True
text: Should I stay quarantined?	labels: Staying at home and using "social distancing" helps stop the virus from spreading quickly. This helps to reduce the burden on healthcare systems, as there are not enough hospital workers and beds if too many people get sick at once.Social distancing means staying farther away from other people and avoiding groups of people. Since COVID-19 mostly spreads from person-to-person interactions, staying at least 6 feet away from other people can help stop the spread. It is important to use social distancing because people can spread COVID-19 even if they feel fine. It is especially important to use social distancing to protect people who are more likely to get very sick from the disease.	episode_done:True

text: Should I stay quarantined?	labels: Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease. Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure. For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days. Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period.	episode_done:True

We are still learning how COVID-19 spreads and if a deceased body can transmit the virus. One could get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it, and then touching their face (like their mouth, nose, or eyes). Try to avoid kissing washing, and shrouding the body. If washing and shrouding the body are important in your culture or religion, work with your community cultural and religious leaders as well as funeral home staff to try to reduce exposure as much as possible. People who conduct these activities should wear disposable gloves. If fluid splashing is expected, more personal protective equipment may be needed, such as disposable gowns, goggles, and face masks.	episode_done:True

Symptoms haveincluded:cough fever difficulty breathing pneumonia in both lungsIn severe cases, infection can leadto death.Symptoms may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to COVID-19. This is the longest known incubation period for this disease.Recent evidence indicates that the virus can be transmitted to othersfrom someone who is infected but not showing symptoms. This includes peoplewho:have not yet developed symptoms (pre-symptomatic) never develop symptoms (asymptomatic)While experts know that these kinds of transmissions are happening amongthose in close contact or in close physical settings, it is not known to whatextent.

text: when covid 19 is going to stop?	labels: Right now, COVID-19 mostly spreads from person to person. But experts agree that the virus likely came from bats and may have passed through another type of animal in China before spreading to people. If you are going to travel, check the latest health notices for up-to-date advice before you leave. Avoid contact with animals, including wild meat and live animal markets.Animal importers, rescues, and adoptive families should limit or postpone importing animals from affected areas. If animals are imported from an affected area, monitor them closely for illness. Call a veterinarian if they get sick and call before bringing them to the office so that they can prepare.	episode_done:True
text: should I wear a mask?	labels: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others. If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time. That is because there are not enough of these masks for health care workers. Health care workers need these masks to stay safe and to take care of sick patients. If you have extra surgical or N95 masks, please donate them to your local healthcare facility.	episode_done:True
text: should I wear a mask?	labels: Children under the age of 2 years should not wear any type of masks. Because babies' airways are smaller, breathing through a mask is even harder on them and they are more likely to suffocate if they use a mask. Older infants or young toddlers are not likely to keep the mask on and will likely try to remove it. This will mean they are touching their face more and could infect themselves with the virus. It is safest to keep children at home and follow social distancing.	episode_done:True

text: should I wear a mask?	labels: CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public when other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission of the coronavirus. The purpose of wearing cloth face coverings in public is to slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others. Read more about types of face masks and FDA’s emergency use authorization for non-surgical face masks.	episode_done:True
text: should I wear a mask?	labels: If you are having symptoms of COVID-19, call your health care provider to be tested. If you do not have a health care provider, call 2-1-1 to be connected with a local community or hospital-connected clinic for referral to a test site.

text: Do I need to wear a mask I heard it s worse if you touch your face?	labels: Generally, do not touch the body of someone who has died of COVID-19. We are still learning how COVID-19 spreads and if a deceased body can transmit the virus. One could get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it, and then touching their face (like their mouth, nose, or eyes). Try to avoid kissing washing, and shrouding the body. If washing and shrouding the body are important in your culture or religion, work with your community cultural and religious leaders as well as funeral home staff to try to reduce exposure as much as possible. People who conduct these activities should wear disposable gloves. If fluid splashing is expected, more personal protective equipment may be needed, such as disposable gowns, goggles, and face masks.	episode_done:True
text: Do I need to wear a mask I heard it s worse if you touch your face?	labels: If you do not have any symptoms, you will be asked to:1. Self-quarantine for 14 days after you get home.2. Do not have any visitors, especially older adults, or those with health problems who are higher risk of severe illness. 3. Monitor your health for fever, cough, or trouble breathing. 4. Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use an alcohol based hand sanitizer that is at least 60% alcohol. 5. Cover your mouth and nose with your arm or a tissue when coughing or sneezing. Throw away the tissue right after and wash your hands. If you start to have symptoms like a cough or fever within the 14 days:1. Continue to self-isolate from others.2. Call a healthcare professional or a public health authority and tell them your symptoms and travel history. Follow their instructions.3.If your symptoms are severe - such as pain or pressure in the chest that won't go away, trouble breathing, feeling confused or unable to arouse, or lips or face that look blue, seek medical care right away. Please contact your medical provider if you have questions about your health and safety.	episode_done:True

text: How many young adults are being hospitalised Like in percentage?	labels: A recent study shows that the virus can live in the air and on surfaces from several hours to several days. On plastic, it can live for up to 72 hours (3 days). On stainless steel, it can live for up to 48 hours (2 days). On cardboard, it can live up to 24 hours (1 day). On copper, it can live up to four hours. It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID-19 from these surfaces.  It is still important to regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces as well as packages and mail that come through. Remember to wash your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol based hand sanitizer (60%).	episode_done:True

text: How long does the virus stay in paper money and coins?	labels: Staying at home and using "social distancing" helps stop the virus from spreading quickly. This helps to reduce the burden on healthcare systems, as there are not enough hospital workers and beds if too many people get sick at once.Social distancing means staying farther away from other people and avoiding groups of people. Since COVID-19 mostly spreads from person-to-person interactions, staying at least 6 feet away from other people can help stop the spread. It is important to use social distancing because people can spread COVID-19 even if they feel fine. It is especially important to use social distancing to protect people who are more likely to get very sick from the disease.	episode_done:True
text: How long does the virus stay in paper money and coins?	labels: How long you should be isolated for varies on a case-by-case basis. If you have been sick with COVID-19 and have been in isolation, you should talk to your healthcare provider to decide when you can be released from isolation. Your doctor will look for signs that:-You are fever-free without taking fever-reducing medication -You no longer show symptoms -Sometimes, your doctor might recommend testing respiratory samples to decide if you can be released from isolationOnce you have been released from isolation, then you are no longer considered to be likely to infect other people.	episode_done:True
text: How long does the virus stay in paper money and coins?	labels: COVID-19 can spread in a few different ways. It can spread from person to person if you inhale an infected person's respiratory droplets when they sneezes, coughs, or talk. It can also spead if you touch something that an infected person has touched, like a door knob, elevator button, or bathroom faucet.That's why it's important to wash your hands, avoid touching your face, and practice social distancing to avoid getting sick. That's why it's also important to self-isolate and wear a mask around other household members if you are sick to avoid infecting other people.	episode_done:True
text: How long does the virus stay in paper money and coins?	labels: Together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19 by making a conscious effort to keep a physical distance between each other. Physical (social) distancing is proven to be one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of illness during an outbreak. This means making changes in your everyday routines to minimize close contact with others, including:avoiding crowded places and non-essential gatherings avoiding common greetings, such as handshakes limiting contact with people at higher risk like older adults and those in poor health keeping a distance of at least 2 arms-length (approximately 2 metres) from others	episode_done:True
text: What are the symptoms of corona virus?	labels: Those who are infected with COVID-19 may have little to no symptoms. You may not know you have symptoms of COVID-19 because they are similar to a cold or flu. Symptoms haveincluded:cough fever difficulty breathing pneumonia in both lungsIn severe cases, infection can leadto death.Symptoms may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to COVID-19. This is the longest known incubation period for this disease.Recent evidence indicates that the virus can be transmitted to othersfrom someone who is infected but not showing symptoms. This includes peoplewho:have not yet developed symptoms (pre-symptomatic) never develop symptoms (asymptomatic)While experts know that these kinds of transmissions are happening amongthose in close contact or in close physical settings, it is not known to whatextent.

text: What are the symptoms of corona virus?	labels: Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. There are different types of coronaviruses.Some types of coronavirus are more common in people and some versions are more common in animals. Rarely, a type of the virus that was common in animals can spread to people. "Coronavirus Disease 2019” (which is shortened to "COVID-19") is an example of a type of coronavirus that has recently spread to humans.	episode_done:True

text: what are covid symptoms?	labels: People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. People with mild symptoms are able to recover at home. If you experience a medical emergency such as trouble breathing, call 911 and let the operator know you may have COVID-19. For severe illness, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.  Currently there are no FDA-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of COVID-19. Researchers are studying new drugs, and drugs that are already approved for other health conditions, as possible treatments for COVID-19. The FDA is working with drug manufacturers, researchers, and other partners to accelerate the development process for COVID-19 treatments. CDC has more information for health care providers about these potential treatments. Never take a prescription medicine or drug if it is not prescribed for you by your doctor for your health condition.	episode_done:True

text: How fast does it spread?	labels: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others. If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time. That is because there are not enough of these masks for health care workers. Health care workers need these masks to stay safe and to take care of sick patients. If you have extra surgical or N95 masks, please donate them to your local healthcare facility.	episode_done:True
text: How fast does it spread?	labels: Current thinking is that COVID-19 mostly spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets.
