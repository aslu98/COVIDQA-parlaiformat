IRE1, an ER-membrane-resident ribonuclease (RNase), upon activation catalyses regulated cleavage of select protein-coding and non-coding host RNAs, using an RNase domain which is homologous to that of the known anti-viral effector RNaseL. 	episode_done:True
text: What is discussed in this publication?	labels: The review first discusses the anti-viral mechanism of the OAS/RNaseL system and evasion tactics employed by different viruses.

text: What is the difference between evolution and synthetic constructs?	labels: Evolution is stepwise and accrues mutations gradually over time, whereas synthetic constructs would typically use a known backbone and introduce logical or targeted changes instead of the randomly occurring mutations that are present in naturally isolated viruses such as bat CoV RaTG13.	episode_done:True
text: What is the conclusion of this report?	labels:  there is currently no credible evidence to support the claim that SARS-CoV-2 originated from a laboratory-engineered CoV.

text: What can be a factor in using common vectors for the delivery of vaccines?	labels: commonly employed vectors, for example Salmonella and adenovirus, often have pre-existing immune responses in the host and this has the potential to modify the subsequent immune response to a vectored antigen. 	episode_done:True
text: Is a pre-existing immune response to commonly used delivery vector an advantage or a disadvantage?	labels: for bacterial vectors there can in fact, in some cases, be an enhancement in immunogenicity, typically humoral, while for viral vectors pre-existing immunity is a hindrance for subsequent induction of cell-mediated responses.	episode_done:True

text: Why are E Coli and lactic acid are safe choices as delivery vectors for vaccines?	labels: E. coli is a commensal and lactic acid bacteria are present in most fermented food items and are therefore naturally present in the host.

text: What is the advantage of Listeria as a  delivery vector for vaccines?	labels: The advantages of Listeria are that it can invade a variety of cells, including antigen presenting cells (APCs). After invading the host cell, Listeria resides inside the phagosome; however, it can escape the phagosome with the help of listeriolysin O (LLO; Hly) and reside in the cytoplasm of the cells, thereby efficiently presenting antigen to both CD8 and CD4 T cells 	episode_done:True

text: Why are some poxvirus  ideally suited as vaccine delivery vectors?	labels: They are ideal candidate vectors due to their large DNA-packing capacity and their thermal and genetic stability 	episode_done:True
text: What is the advantage of adenovirus as vaccine delivery vector?	labels: adenovirus (Ad) vector is another of the most widely evaluated vectors to date to express heterologous antigens, due to ease of production, safety profile, genetic stability, the ease of DNA genome manipulation, and the ability to stimulate both innate and adaptive immune responses and induce both T and B cell responses 	episode_done:True
text: What are important criteria for selecting vaccine delivery vectors?	labels: a vaccine should be inexpensive, so that it can be administered to a large population at minimal cost	episode_done:True
text: What are important criteria for selecting vaccine delivery vectors?	labels: Safety is a major concern, as even a low level of toxicity is unacceptable 	episode_done:True
text: What are important criteria for selecting vaccine delivery vectors?	labels: long-lasting cellular and (where appropriate) humoral immune responses to the vectored antigen must be induced following administration of these vaccines, preferably with a single dose	episode_done:True
text: What happens when a recipient of a vaccine has immune response to the delivery vector?	labels: considering a vector such as Salmonella, if a host has previously been infected there will exist robust B and T memory responses, and as such, when a vaccination is delivered, an anamnestic response to the Salmonella antigens will be induced (while the response to the vectored antigen will be a primary response)	episode_done:True
text: What is the effect of host immune response to the delivery vector on the efficacy of vaccination?	labels: for virally vectored antigens, the existence of pre-existing immunity to the vector (particularly neutralizing antibody) will restrict delivery of the virus into cells, thereby effectively reducing the dose of the vectored antigen. Again, this might be expected to result in a reduction in the antigenicity of the vectored antigen.	episode_done:True
text: What is the effect of host immune response to the delivery vector on the efficacy of vaccination?	labels: theoretically reduce the exposure of the heterologous antigen to the immune system, as the vector is rapidly cleared.	episode_done:True
text: What is an example  of the effect of immunity to the  delivery vector on the efficacy of vaccination?	labels: mice that had been primed with Salmonella alone, and then boosted with Salmonella expressing tetC, induced much lower anti-tetC responses than mice that had not been primed. This argues strongly that prior immunological immunity to the vector can seriously dampen subsequent antigen-specific humoral responses.	episode_done:True
text: What is the effect of host immune response to viral delivery vectors in the efficacy of vaccination?	labels: pre-existing immunity is a major obstacle of many viralvectored vaccines, such as Ad serotype 5 or herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1), where the rate of seroprevalence to these viruses is very high [40-45 % and 70 % (or more) of the US population, respectively] 	episode_done:True
text: What is the effect of host immune response to  the viral delivery vector on the efficacy of vaccination?	labels: Vector-specific antibodies may impede the induction of immune responses to the vaccine-encoded antigens, as they may reduce the dose and time of exposure of the target cells to the vaccinated antigens	episode_done:True
text: What is the effect of host immune response to the delivery vector on  the efficacy of vaccination?	labels:  In a large-scale clinical trial (STEP) of an Ad serotype 5 (AdHu5)-based HIV-1 vaccine, the vaccines showed a lack of efficacy and tended to increase the risk of HIV-1 infection in vaccine recipients who had pre-existing neutralizing antibodies to AdHu5 (	episode_done:True
text: What are methods to avoid the effect vector immunity on the efficacy of vaccination?	labels:  the use of vectors derived from nonhuman sources, using human viruses of rare serotypes (Kahl et al., 2010; Lasaro & Ertl, 2009) , heterologous prime-boost approaches (Liu et al., 2008) , homologous reimmunization (Steffensen et al., 2012) and removing key neutralizing epitopes on the surface of viral capsid proteins (Gabitzsch & Jones, 2011; Roberts et al., 2006) 	episode_done:True
text: What are methods to  avoid the effect of vector immune response on the efficacy of vaccination?	labels: The inhibitory effect of pre-existing immunity can also be avoided by masking the Ad vector inside dendritic cells (DCs) (Steffensen et al., 2012) . In addition, mucosal vaccination or administration of higher vaccine doses can overcome pre-existing immunity problems (Alexander et al., 2012; Belyakov et al., 1999; Priddy et al., 2008; Xiang et al., 2003) . 	episode_done:True
text: How does cell-mediated immunity to viral delivery vector, reduce the immune response to vaccine?	labels:  this is because viruses will induce neutralizing antibody on the first dose, and in subsequent doses this antibody will limit the number of transduced cells, therefore limiting the responses. This is particularly a problem with a common viral vector such as Ad, where a large proportion of the population will have immunological memory against common serotypes	episode_done:True
text: How can vectors for which host has immunity, be used differently to increase the efficacy of vaccination?	labels:  it will be possible to utilize such vectors only by developing vaccines from alternative serotypes. It may be that a vector such as Pre-existing immunity against vaccine vectors attenuated influenza virus, with the ability to easily develop reassortants, will be useful in this context.  In addition, immunological memory in the form of opsonizing antibody certainly plays an important role in the early uptake of Salmonella by macrophages and DC. This may be beneficial, as the live bacterial vector used for delivery purposes harbours mutations in genes encoding proteins responsible for their survival in the animal host. This not only encumbers their ability to cause disease, making them safe live vectors, but also limits the number of replications. The presence of opsonizing antibodies should mean a higher level of bacterial uptake, leading to higher presentation to the immune system and therefore a better immune response.	episode_done:True

text: What was the conclusion of the study ?	labels:  In both bat species, the strongest antiviral responses were countered by the virus spreading more quickly from cell to cell. This suggests that bat immune defenses may drive the evolution of faster transmitting viruses, and while bats are well protected from the harmful effects of their own prolific viruses, other creatures like humans are not.	episode_done:True

We used generalized additive models to infer the time course of all cell culture replicates and construct the multi-trial dataset to which we eventually fit our mechanistic transmission model for each cell line-virus-specific combinatio	episode_done:True
text: How was the modeling carried out?	labels: an innovative combination of in vitro experimentation and within-host modeling to explore the impact of unique bat immunity on virus dynamics.	episode_done:True
text: What was the finding in this study?	labels: that bat cell lines demonstrated a signature of enhanced interferon-mediated immune response, of either constitutive or induced form, which allowed for establishment of rapid within-host, cell-to-cell virus transmission rates 	episode_done:True
text: What supports the results?	labels: by both data-independent bifurcation analysis of our mean field theoretical model, as well as fitting of this model to viral infection time series established in bat cell culture.	episode_done:True
text: What was additionally demonstrated?	labels: the antiviral state induced by the interferon pathway protects live cells from mortality in tissue culture, resulting in in vitro epidemics of extended duration that enhance the probability of establishing a long-term persistent infection.	episode_done:True
text: What do  the studies suggest?	labels: that viruses evolved in bat reservoirs possessing enhanced IFN capabilities could achieve more rapid within-host transmission rates without causing pathology to their hosts. Such rapidly-reproducing viruses would likely generate extreme virulence upon spillover to hosts lacking similar immune capacities to bats.	episode_done:True
text: What was the methodology for this study?	labels: we first developed a novel, within-host, theoretical model elucidating the effects of unique bat immunity, then undertook bifurcation analysis of the model's equilibrium properties under immune absent, induced, and constitutive assumptions. We considered a cell line to be constitutively immune if possessing any number of antiviral cells at disease-free equilibrium but allowed the extent of constitutive immunity to vary across the parameter range for ", the constitutive rate of antiviral acquisition. 	episode_done:True
text: What was demonstrated in deriving the equation for R 0?	labels:  invasion threshold is elevated at high values of constitutive antiviral acquisition,	episode_done:True
text: What is a conclusion of the modeling?	labels: Constitutive immune processes can thus prohibit pathogen invasion, while induced responses, by definition, can only control infections post-hoc.	episode_done:True
text: What is a conclusion of the study?	labels: Regardless of mechanism (induced or constitutive), interferon-stimulated antiviral cells appear to play a key role in maintaining longer term or persistent infections by safeguarding susceptible cells from rapid infection and concomitant cell death. 	episode_done:True
text: What do  fits to rVSV-MARV infections on PaKiT01 cells suggest?	labels: that the constitutive IFN-a expression characteristic of P. alecto cells may represent more of a constitutive immune priming process than a perpetual, functional, antiviral defense.	episode_done:True
text: What do the findings indicate?	labels: enhanced IFN-mediated immune pathways in bat reservoirs may promote elevated within-host virus replication rates prior to cross-species emergence. 	episode_done:True
text: What is presented in this study?	labels: general methods to study cross-scale viral dynamics, which suggest that within-host persistence is supported by robust antiviral responses characteristic of bat immune processes. 	episode_done:True
text: What is a conclusion of  this study?	labels:  Viruses which evolve rapid replication rates under these robust antiviral defenses may pose the greatest hazard for cross-species pathogen emergence into spillover hosts with immune systems that differ from those unique to bats. 	episode_done:True

text: What is the effect of these factors?	labels: These factors heighten local inflammation and the infiltration of granulocytes, T-cells and B-cells (Wark and Gibson, 2006; Braciale et al., 2012) . The increased inflammation, in turn, worsens the symptoms of airway diseases.	episode_done:True
text: What additional effects are caused  in patients with asthma and patients with CRS with nasal polyp ?	labels: viral infections such as RV and RSV promote a Type 2-biased immune response (Becker, 2006; Jackson et al., 2014; Jurak et al., 2018) . This amplifies the basal type 2 inflammation resulting in a greater release of IL-4, IL-5, IL-13, RANTES and eotaxin and a further increase in eosinophilia, a key pathological driver of asthma and CRSwNP	episode_done:True
text: What is the result of increased eosinophilia?	labels: worsens the classical symptoms of disease and may further lead to life-threatening conditions due to breathing difficulties	episode_done:True
text: What are the effects for patients with COPD and patients with CRS without nasal polyp (CRSsNP) ?	labels: are more neutrophilic in nature due to the expression of neutrophil chemoattractants such as CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 (Cukic et al., 2012; Brightling and Greening, 2019) . The pathology of these airway diseases is characterized by airway remodeling due to the presence of remodeling factors such as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) released from infiltrating neutrophils (Linden et al., 2019) .

text: What  happens in the case of COPD?	labels:  increased ILC2 activation, which retain the capability of differentiating to ILC1, may also further augment the neutrophilic response and further aggravate the exacerbation	episode_done:True
text: What happens during viral infection of healthy individuals?	labels:  these factors are not released to any great extent and do not activate an ILC2 response during viral infection in healthy individuals (Yan et al., 2016; Tan et al., 2018a) ; despite augmenting a type 2 exacerbation in chronically inflamed airways (Jurak et al., 2018) . These classical mechanisms of viral induced acute exacerbations are summarized in Figure 1 	episode_done:True
text: What happens upon viral infection in the airway?	labels: antiviral state will be activated to clear the invading pathogen from the airway. Immune response and injury factors released from the infected epithelium normally would induce a rapid type 1 immunity that facilitates viral clearance. 	episode_done:True
text: What is the effect of the inflammation of the airway?	labels:  However, in the inflamed airway, the cytokines and chemokines released instead augmented the inflammation present in the chronically inflamed airway, strengthening the neutrophilic infiltration in COPD airway, and eosinophilic infiltration in the asthmatic airway.

text: Where is this  especially evident?	labels: in weak type 1 inflammation-inducing viruses such as RV and RSV	episode_done:True
text: What are other  effects?	labels: there are also evidence of reduced type I (IFNÎ²) and III (IFNÎ») interferon production due to type 2-skewed inflammation, which contributes to imperfect clearance of the virus resulting in persistence of viral components, or the live virus in the airway epithelium 	episode_done:True
text: What is the  effect of viral components remaining in the airway?	labels: antiviral genes such as type I interferons, inflammasome activating factors and cytokines remained activated resulting in prolong airway inflammation	episode_done:True

The massive cell death induced may result in worsening of the acute exacerbation due to the release of their cellular content into the airway, further evoking an inflammatory response in the airway 	episode_done:True
text: What  may the destruction of the epithelial barrier  cause?	labels:  further contact with other pathogens and allergens in the airway which may then prolong exacerbations or results in new exacerbations.	episode_done:True
text: What may the epithelial destruction cause?	labels: may also promote further epithelial remodeling during its regeneration as viral infection induces the expression of remodeling genes such as MMPs and growth factors .

text: What are ways in  which 2019-nCOV is transmitted?	labels: We found the presence of 2019-nCoV in anal swabs and blood as well, and more anal swab positives than oral swab positives in a later stage of infection, suggesting shedding and thereby transmitted through oralâfecal route.	episode_done:True
text: Is oral swab for detecting 2019-nCOV infection, sufficient?	labels: the current strategy for the detection of viral RNA in oral swabs used for 2019-nCoV diagnosis is not perfect. The virus may be present in anal swabs or blood of patients when oral swabs detection negative.	episode_done:True
text: Is oral swab for detecting 2019-nCOV infection, sufficient?	labels:  patients infected with 2019-nCoV may harbour the virus in the intestine at the early or late stage of disease. It is also worth to note none of the patients with viremia blood had positive swabs. These patients would likely be considered as 2019-nCoV negative through routine surveillance, and thus pose a threat to other people.	episode_done:True
text: What other tests should be considered for 2019-nCOV epidemiology?	labels: serology should be considered for 2019-nCoV epidemiology.	episode_done:True
text: What tests should  be done before a 2019-nCOV infected patient is discharged?	labels: we cannot discharge a patient purely based on oral swabs negative, who may still shed the virus by oral-fecal route. Above all, we strongly suggest using viral IgM and IgG serological test to confirm an infection, considering the unreliable results from oral swabs detection	episode_done:True

text: What were the surveillance objectives?	labels: to: describe the key epidemiological and clinical characteristics of COVID-19 cases detected in Europe; inform country preparedness; and improve further case detection and management. 	episode_done:True
text: What is the adopted WHO case definition?	labels: a confirmed case was a person with laboratory confirmation of SARS-CoV-2 infection (ECDC recommended two separate SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR tests), irrespective of clinical signs and symptoms, whereas a probable case was a suspect case for whom testing for SARS-CoV-2 was inconclusive or positive using a pan-coronavirus assay	episode_done:True
text: When was the first reported death in France?	labels: 15 February	episode_done:True
text: What is the presumed incubation period?	labels:  up to 14 days [	episode_done:True

text: How many cases were hospitalised?	labels: All but two cases were hospitalised (35 of 37 where information on hospitalisation was reported)	episode_done:True
text: Why were they hospitalised?	labels:  it is likely that most were hospitalised to isolate the person rather than because of severe disease. 	episode_done:True
text: What was time from onset to hospitalisation?	labels: ranged between 0 and 10 days with a mean of 3.7 days 	episode_done:True
text: What was the duration of hospitalisation?	labels: The mean number of days to hospitalisation was 2.5 days for cases imported from China, but 4.6 days for those infected in Europe.	episode_done:True
text: Why was this?	labels: This was mostly a result of delays in identifying the index cases of the two clusters in France and Germany. In the German cluster, for example, the first three cases detected locally were hospitalised in a mean of 5.7 days, whereas the following six took only a mean of 2 days to be hospitalised.	episode_done:True
text: How many cases reported symptoms at this point? 	labels:  31 cases	episode_done:True

text: How many reported viral pneumonia?	labels: two reported in Italy and two reported in France	episode_done:True
text: What was the clinical evolution of the hospitalised cases?	labels: All hospitalised cases had a benign clinical evolution except four,	episode_done:True
text: What happened to three cases who were aged 65 years or over?	labels: were admitted to intensive care and required respiratory support and one French case died.	episode_done:True
text: What happened to the case who died?	labels: was hospitalised for 21 days and required intensive care and mechanical ventilation for 19 days	episode_done:True
text: What was the duration of hospitalisation reported for 16 cases ?	labels: a median of 13 days (range: 8-23 days)	episode_done:True
text: How were the assays confirmed?	labels: according to specific assays targeting at least two separate genes (envelope (E) gene as a screening test and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) gene or nucleoprotein (N) gene for confirmation) 	episode_done:True
text: What were the specimen types for 21 cases?	labels: 15 had positive nasopharyngeal swabs, nine had positive throat swabs, three cases had positive sputum, two had a positive nasal swab, one case had a positive nasopharyngeal aspirate and one a positive endotracheal aspirate.	episode_done:True

text: What were the two contexts for transmission?	labels: sporadic cases among travellers from China (14 cases) and cases who acquired infection due to subsequent local transmission in Europe (21 cases).	episode_done:True
text: What  does the analysis show on the difference between locally acquired cases vs imported cases?	labels: that the time from symptom onset to hospitalisation/case isolation was about 3 days longer for locally acquired cases than for imported cases.	episode_done:True
text: What is required for locally acquired cases?	labels: significant resources for contact tracing and quarantine, and countries should be prepared to allocate considerable public health resources during the containment phase, should local clusters emerge in their population. In addition, prompt sharing of information on cases and contacts through international notification systems such as the International Health Regulations (IHR) mechanism and the European Commission's European Early Warning and Response System is essential to contain international spread of infection. 	episode_done:True
text: What was common to all imported cases?	labels: had a history of travel to China	episode_done:True
text: What testing and detection are needed?	labels: Testing of suspected cases based on geographical risk of importation needs to be complemented with additional approaches to ensure early detection of local circulation of COVID-19, including through testing of severe acute respiratory infections in hospitals irrespectively of travel history as recommended in the WHO case definition updated on 27 February 2020 	episode_done:True
text: What did the finding prompt ECDC to do?	labels: include fever among several clinical signs or symptoms indicative for the suspected case definition.	episode_done:True
text: Why is understanding the infection-severity  critical ?	labels: to help plan for the impact on the healthcare system and the wider population.	episode_done:True
text: Why are serological tests vital?	labels: to understand the proportion of cases who are asymptomatic.	episode_done:True
text: How can hospital based surveillance help?	labels: help estimate the incidence of severe cases and identify risk factors for severity and death	episode_done:True
text: How can present systems of surveillance be used?	labels: Established hospital surveillance systems that are in place for influenza and other diseases in Europe may be expanded for this purpose. In addition, a number of countries in Europe are adapting and, in some cases, already using existing sentinel primary care based surveillance systems for influenza to detect community transmission of SARS-CoV-2	episode_done:True
text: How will  this approach used?	labels: will be used globally to help identify evidence of widespread community transmission and, should the virus spread and containment no longer be deemed feasible, to monitor intensity of disease transmission, trends and its geographical spread.	episode_done:True
text: Why is additional research needed?	labels:  to complement surveillance data to build knowledge on the infectious period, modes of transmission, basic and effective reproduction numbers, and effectiveness of prevention and case management options also in settings outside of China.	episode_done:True

Recent MERS-CoV infection is another example for severe disease caused by used-to-be-less pathogenic coronaviruses. Shi and colleagues [19] by using NGS have discovered many unknown animal viruses from bat, especially some important paramyxoviruses and reoviruses. Filovirus has also been identified in bat with potential severe outcomes. Lyssaviruses (with many genotypes, including rabies virus) in the Rhabdoviridae family have been linked with severe fatal human cases, even in the developed countries, including Australia, with the bites of bats in the city [20, 21] .	episode_done:True

text: What was the death toll in the 1918-1919 Spanish Influenza epidemic?	labels: Total deaths were estimated at z50 million (577) and were arguably as high as 100 mil- lion 	episode_done:True
text: Are the modern day Influenza viruses related to the 1918 Spanish Influenza virus?	labels:  All inï¬uenza A pandemics since that time, and indeed almost all cases of inï¬uenza A worldwide (except- ing human infections from avian Viruses such as H5N1 and H7N7), have been caused by descendants of the 1918 Virus, including âdriftedâ H1N1 Viruses and reassorted H2N2 and H3N2 Viruses.	episode_done:True
text: Why is the Spanish Influenza virus the Mother of the modern influenza viruses?	labels: The latter are composed of key genes from the 1918 Virus, updated by subsequently-incorâ porated avian inï¬uenza genes that code for novel surface     *Armed Forces Institute of Pathology, Rockville, Maryland, USA; and TNational Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland, USA  proteins, making the 1918 Virus indeed the âmotherâ of all pandemics.	episode_done:True
text: When was it  determined that the 1918  pandemic was caused by the H1N1 Influenza virus?	labels: That question did not begin to be resolved until the 1930s, when closely related inï¬uenza Viruses (now known to be H1N1 Viruses) were isolated, ï¬rst from pigs and shortly thereafter from humans. Seroepidemiologic studies soon linked both of these viruses to the 1918 pandemic	episode_done:True
text: Did the Spanish Influenza or Swine flu or the H1N1 virus disappear in humans for some time?	labels:  descendants of the 1918 Virus still persists enzootically in pigs. They probably also circulated continuously in humans, undergoing gradual antigenic drift and causing annual epidemics, until the 1950s. With the appearance of a new H2N2 pandemic strain in 1957 (âAsian ï¬uâ), the direct H1N1 Viral descen- dants 0f the 1918 pandemic strain disappeared from human circulation entirely, although the related lineage persisted enzootically in pigs.	episode_done:True
text: When did the Swine Flu (Spanish Influenza) virus reappear in humans?	labels:  But in 1977, human H1N1 Viruses suddenly âreemergedâ from a laboratory freezer (9). They continue to circulate endemically and epidemically.	episode_done:True
text: What descendant  lineages of the swine flu (Spanish Influenza) virus were identified in 2006?	labels:  2 major descendant lineages of the 1918 H1N1 Virus, as well as 2 additional reassortant lineages, persist naturally: a human epidemic/endemic H1N1 line- age, a porcine enzootic H1N1 lineage (so-called classic swine ï¬u), and the reassorted human H3N2 Virus lineage, which like the human H1N1 Virus, has led to a porcine H3N2 lineage.	episode_done:True
text: Are the modern descendant influenza viruses as dangerous as the 1918 parent swine flu (Spanish Influenza) H1N1 virus?	labels: None of these Viral descendants, however, approaches the pathogenicity of the 1918 parent Virus.	episode_done:True
text: How dangerous are the modern H1N1 (swine flu) and the H3N2 (Influenza A) viruses compared  to the 1918 H1N1 (swine flu Spanish Influenza)  viruses?	labels: the human H1N1 and H3N2 lin- eages have both been associated with substantially lower rates ofillness and death than the virus of 1918. In fact, cur- rent H1N1 death rates are even lower than those for H3N2 lineage strains (prevalent from 1968 until the present).	episode_done:True
text: Are the descendant H1N1 strains of the 1918 H1N1 swine flu (Spanish Influenza) virus, still prevalent?	labels: H1N1 Viruses descended from the 1918 strain, as well as  H3N2 Viruses, have now been cocirculating worldwide for 29 years and show little evidence of imminent extinction.	episode_done:True
text: Is the origin and epidemiology of the 1918 swine flu (Spanish Influenza) known?	labels: ongoing studies to map Virulence factors are yielding interesting results. The 1918 sequence data, however, leave unanswered questions about the ori- gin of the Virus (19) and about the epidemiology of the pandemic.	episode_done:True
text: What is the geographical origin of the H1N1 swine flu ?	labels: Historical and epidemiologic data are inade- quate to identify the geographic origin of the Virus (21), and recent phylogenetic analysis of the 1918 Viral genome does not place the Virus in any geographic context	episode_done:True
text: Is the geographical origin of the 1918 H1N1 swine flu known?	labels: Confounding deï¬nite assignment of a geographic point of origin, the 1918 pandemic spread more or less simultaneously in 3 distinct waves during an z12-month period in 191871919, in Europe, Asia, and North America (the ï¬rst wave was best described in the United States in March 1918)	episode_done:True
text: What is an unique feature of the 1918 swine flu?	labels: the simultaneous (or nearly simultaneous) infection of humans and swin	episode_done:True
text: What season or  time of the year do the new strains of influenza emerge?	labels: Historical records since the 16th century suggest that new inï¬uenza pandemics may appear at any time of year, not necessarily in the familiar annual winter patterns of interpandemic years,	episode_done:True
text: Once appeared, when do the influenza like diseases occur in subsequent years?	labels: confronted by the selection pressures of population immu- nity, these pandemic Viruses begin to drift genetically and eventually settle into a pattern of annual epidemic recur- rences caused by the drifted Virus variants.	episode_done:True
text: When did the first wave of the H1N1 swine flu (Spanish Influenza) occur?	labels:  a ï¬rst or spring wave began in March 1918 and spread unevenly through the United States, Europe, and possibly Asia over the next 6 months	episode_done:True
text: What was the death rate in the first wave of the 1918 swine flu pandemic?	labels:  Illness rates were high, but death rates in most locales were not appreciably above normal.	episode_done:True
text: When were the second and the third wave of the 1918-1919 swine flu pandemic?	labels:  A sec- ond or fall wave spread globally from September to November 1918 and was highly fatal. In many nations, a third wave occurred in early 1919 	episode_done:True
text: What was the primary difference between the first wave and the 2nd and 3rd wave of the 1918-1919 swine flu pandemic?	labels: the much higher fre- quency of complicated, severe, and fatal cases in the last 2 waves.	episode_done:True
text: Why the human influenza viruses do not disappear after herd immunity is developed?	labels: The occurrence, and to some extent the severity, of recur- rent annual outbreaks, are driven by Viral antigenic drift, with an antigenic variant Virus emerging to become domi- nant	episode_done:True
text: What are the circumstances that promote the spread of influenza virus?	labels:  lower environ- mental temperatures and human nasal temperatures (bene- ï¬cial to thermolabile Viruses such as inï¬uenza), optimal humidity, increased crowding indoors, and imperfect ven- tilation due to closed windows and suboptimal airï¬ow	episode_done:True
text: Do seasonal temperatures and humidity explain  the appearance of the three waves of the 1918 swine flu?	labels: such factors cannot explain the 3 pandemic waves of 1918-1919, which occurred in the spring-sum- mer, summerâfall, and winter (of the Northern Hemisphere), respectively.

The second wave caused simultaneous outbreaks in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres from September to November. 	episode_done:True
text: Which virus samples  from the 1918 swine flu pandemic have been identified?	labels: pandemic Virus samples we have yet identiï¬ed are from second-wave patients	episode_done:True
text: Are viruses in the first and third waves of the 1918 swine flu pandemic same or derived from the virus from the second wave of the swine flu?	labels: nothing can yet be said about whether the ï¬rst (spring) wave, or for that matter, the third wave, represented circulation of the same Virus or variants of it	episode_done:True
text: Was the 1918 swine flu virus novel to humans are was it derived from older viruses?	labels: Viral sequence data now suggest that the entire 1918 Virus was novel to humans in, or shortly before, 1918, and that it thus was not a reassortant Virus produced from old existing strains that acquired 1 or more new genes	episode_done:True
text: Do avian flu viruses change over long periods?	labels: Inï¬uenza Virus gene sequences from a number ofï¬xed specimens ofwild birds collected circa 1918 show little difference from avian Viruses isolated today, indicating that avian Viruses likely undergo little antigenic change in their natural hosts even over long periods	episode_done:True
text: What  is the typical age profile of mortality in Influenza diseases?	labels: The curve of inï¬uenza deaths by age at death has histor- ically, for at least 150 years, been U-shaped (Figure 2), exhibiting mortality peaks in the very young and the very old, with a comparatively low frequency of deaths at all ages in between	episode_done:True
text: What was the age profile of mortality in the 1918 swine flu?	labels: age-speciï¬c death rates in the 1918 pandemic exhibited a distinct pattern that has not been documented before or since: a âWâshapedâ curve, similar to the familiar U-shaped curve but with the addition of a third (middle) distinct peak of deaths in young adults z20410 years of age	episode_done:True
text: Which age group was most susceptible to die during the 1918 swine flu pandemic?	labels: Persons 65 years of age in 1918 had a dispro- portionately high inï¬uenza incidence	episode_done:True

text: What theory provides partial explanation for the age-specific profile of the death rate in the 1918 swine flu pandemic?	labels:  the 1918 Virus had an intrinsically high Virulence, tem- pered only in those patients who had been born before 1889, e.g., because of exposure to a then-circulating Virus capable of providing partial immunoprotection against the 1918 Virus strain only in persons old enough (>35 years) to have been infected during that prior era 	episode_done:True
text: Is there a difference in the pathologic feature and course of disease between modern influenza pandemics and the 1918 swine flu pandemic?	labels:  the 1918 pandemic was different in degree, but not in kind, from previous and subsequent pandemics. Despite the extraordi- nary number of global deaths, most inï¬uenza cases in 1918 (>95% in most locales in industrialized nations) were mild and essentially indistinguishable from inï¬uenza cases today. 	episode_done:True
text: Could the 1918 swine flu virus been controlled  by modern day drugs or vaccines?	labels: the 1918 and 1918-like Viruses would be as sensitive as other typical Virus strains to the Food and Drug Administrationiapproved antiinï¬uenza drugs riman- tadine and oseltamivir.	episode_done:True
text: Why was there such a high death rate in the 19118 swine flu pandemic?	labels: Clinically and pathologically, these high death rates appear to be the result of several factors, including a higher proportion of severe and complicated infections of the respiratory tract, rather than involvement of organ systems outside the normal range of the inï¬uenza Virus. Also, the deaths were concentrated in an unusually young age group	episode_done:True
text: Is the molecular basis of human adaptation of a virus understood?	labels: While data bearing on inï¬uenza Virus human cell adaptation (e.g., receptor binding) are beginning to be understood at the molecular level, the basis for Viral adaptation to efï¬cient human-to- human spread, the chief prerequisite for pandemic emer- gence, is unknown for any inï¬uenza Virus.	episode_done:True

text: Should I practice social distancing?	labels: Together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19 by making a conscious effort to keep a physical distance between each other. Physical (social) distancing is proven to be one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of illness during an outbreak. This means making changes in your everyday routines to minimize close contact with others, including:avoiding crowded places and non-essential gatherings avoiding common greetings, such as handshakes limiting contact with people at higher risk like older adults and those in poor health keeping a distance of at least 2 arms-length (approximately 2 metres) from others	episode_done:True
text: Should I practice social distancing?	labels: Staying at least six feet (2 meters) from other people can help reduce the spread. But this does not mean for sure that you will not get the virus.	episode_done:True
text: Should I practice social distancing?	labels: If you are having symptoms of COVID-19, call your health care provider to be tested. If you do not have a health care provider, call 2-1-1 to be connected with a local community or hospital-connected clinic for referral to a test site. Health care providers are encouraged to order a test for any child or adult who is showing symptoms of COVID-19, even if their symptoms are mild.	episode_done:True
text: Should I practice social distancing?	labels: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others. If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time. That is because there are not enough of these masks for health care workers. Health care workers need these masks to stay safe and to take care of sick patients. If you have extra surgical or N95 masks, please donate them to your local healthcare facility.	episode_done:True
text: Should I practice social distancing?	labels: Social distancing means maintaining a physical distance (approximately 6 feet or 2 meters) from others you do not live with. This includes when you're inside a store or outside for exercise. The COVID-19 virus spreads easily from person-to-person. It travels through the air when a sick person coughs, sneezes or talks. One way to contain the spread of COVID-19 is to stop people from sharing it. Without a vaccine or treatment, we can help contain the virus by: Staying at home to protect others if you are sick. Staying home is still the best way to lower our risk of COVID-19, but small groups of 10 or fewer people are now allowed if health and safety precautions are followed. Learn how to safely connect with friends and family. Continuing to go outside, take walks, do essential errands while maintaining a physical distance from others and practicing proper hygiene. Remember that ticks are active this time of year. Find out how to Be Tick Smart and prevent tick bites. Wearing a cloth face mask or covering in public settings when a physical distance of at least 6 feet is difficult to maintain, especially at the grocery store, pharmacy, doctorÃ¢ÂÂs office, hospital or other essential business or office, and on a crowded sidewalk or bike path. Washing your hands (adults and children) any time you go inside, before you eat, and before you spend time with people who are more vulnerable to the effects of COVID-19.	episode_done:True
text: Someone from quarantaine came to my office and stayed 20min Is it a risk?	labels: Most people who get COVID-19 will be able to recover at home. If possible, have the sick household member use a separate room and bathroom. Try to have the sick family member stay away from other people as much as they can. Clean and sanitize your hands and home regularly.Don't share personal items like utensils, foods, and drinks.The sick person should stay at home except to get medical care. Please contact a health care provider right away if they have one of these severe symptoms: -Trouble breathing-Shortness of breath-Chest pain or pressure that won't go away -Feeling very tired or unable to wake up from sleeping -Lips or face look bluePlease keep in mind that this is not the full list.

text: Someone from quarantaine came to my office and stayed 20min Is it a risk?	labels: You could be at higher risk of catching COVID-19 if many people have gotten COVID-19 near where you live. You could also have a higher risk if you visit places where many people are getting sick with COVID-19.Right now, in most places, the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. But this is changing quickly in many cities and areas around the world.	episode_done:True
text: Someone from quarantaine came to my office and stayed 20min Is it a risk?	labels: You can reduce your risk of getting sick by:1. Staying at home as much as you can. Only go out when you really need to (for groceries, for example) 2. If you do go out, keep at least 6 foot (2 meter) distance between you and other people. 3. Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, sneezing, using the restroom, coming home and before eating or makng food. ALWAYS wash your hands with soap and water if your hands are visibly dirty.4. If you don't have soap and water, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that has at least 60% alcohol. 5. Clean and disinfect surfaces that people touch a lot (e.g. tables, countertops, light switches, door knobs, cabinet handles). If you or someone in your family gets sick, stay at home, except when getting medical care, until your doctor says you no longer have to stay home. Cover your coughs and sneezes with tissues, and throw the tissue away.	episode_done:True
text: Someone from quarantaine came to my office and stayed 20min Is it a risk?	labels: Generally, do not touch the body of someone who has died of COVID-19. We are still learning how COVID-19 spreads and if a deceased body can transmit the virus. One could get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it, and then touching their face (like their mouth, nose, or eyes). Try to avoid kissing washing, and shrouding the body. If washing and shrouding the body are important in your culture or religion, work with your community cultural and religious leaders as well as funeral home staff to try to reduce exposure as much as possible. People who conduct these activities should wear disposable gloves. If fluid splashing is expected, more personal protective equipment may be needed, such as disposable gowns, goggles, and face masks.	episode_done:True

text: What are the symptoms Is vomiting one of them?	labels: Those who are infected with COVID-19 may have little to no symptoms. You may not know you have symptoms of COVID-19 because they are similar to a cold or flu. Symptoms haveincluded:cough fever difficulty breathing pneumonia in both lungsIn severe cases, infection can leadto death.Symptoms may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to COVID-19. This is the longest known incubation period for this disease.Recent evidence indicates that the virus can be transmitted to othersfrom someone who is infected but not showing symptoms. This includes peoplewho:have not yet developed symptoms (pre-symptomatic) never develop symptoms (asymptomatic)While experts know that these kinds of transmissions are happening amongthose in close contact or in close physical settings, it is not known to whatextent. This means it is extremely important to follow the proven preventative measures.Think you might have COVID-19? Take a self-assessment	episode_done:True
text: What are the symptoms Is vomiting one of them?	labels: The time between exposure to the COVID-19 virus and onset of symptoms is called the âincubation period.â The incubation period for COVID-19 is typically 2 to 14 days, although in some cases it may be longer.	episode_done:True
text: What are the symptoms Is vomiting one of them?	labels: Children and adults have the same COVID-19 symptoms, although children might not get as sick as adults. Children might get a fever, runny nose, or cough. Some children have had vomiting or diarrhea. We are still learning about how COVID-19 affects children.	episode_done:True
text: What are the symptoms Is vomiting one of them?	labels: People might be able to spread the disease before people realize they are sick. But most scientists think that people are most likely to infect others when they have symptoms and feel sick. Canada public health services is doing research to try to answer this question.	episode_done:True
text: What are the symptoms Is vomiting one of them?	labels: Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. There are different types of coronaviruses.Some types of coronavirus are more common in people and some versions are more common in animals. Rarely, a type of the virus that was common in animals can spread to people. "Coronavirus Disease 2019â (which is shortened to "COVID-19") is an example of a type of coronavirus that has recently spread to humans.	episode_done:True
text: Should I stay home?	labels: Staying at home and using "social distancing" helps stop the virus from spreading quickly. This helps to reduce the burden on healthcare systems, as there are not enough hospital workers and beds if too many people get sick at once.Social distancing means staying farther away from other people and avoiding groups of people. Since COVID-19 mostly spreads from person-to-person interactions, staying at least 6 feet away from other people can help stop the spread. It is important to use social distancing because people can spread COVID-19 even if they feel fine. It is especially important to use social distancing to protect people who are more likely to get very sick from the disease.	episode_done:True
text: Should I stay home?	labels: If you are having symptoms of COVID-19, call your health care provider to be tested. If you do not have a health care provider, call 2-1-1 to be connected with a local community or hospital-connected clinic for referral to a test site. Health care providers are encouraged to order a test for any child or adult who is showing symptoms of COVID-19, even if their symptoms are mild.	episode_done:True
text: Should I stay home?	labels: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others. If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time. That is because there are not enough of these masks for health care workers. Health care workers need these masks to stay safe and to take care of sick patients. If you have extra surgical or N95 masks, please donate them to your local healthcare facility.	episode_done:True
text: Should I stay home?	labels: If you do not have any symptoms, you will be asked to:1. Self-quarantine for 14 days after you get home.2. Do not have any visitors, especially older adults, or those with health problems who are higher risk of severe illness. 3. Monitor your health for fever, cough, or trouble breathing. 4. Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use an alcohol based hand sanitizer that is at least 60% alcohol. 5. Cover your mouth and nose with your arm or a tissue when coughing or sneezing. Throw away the tissue right after and wash your hands. If you start to have symptoms like a cough or fever within the 14 days:1. Continue to self-isolate from others.2. Call a healthcare professional or a public health authority and tell them your symptoms and travel history. Follow their instructions.3.If your symptoms are severe - such as pain or pressure in the chest that won't go away, trouble breathing, feeling confused or unable to arouse, or lips or face that look blue, seek medical care right away.

There was a tiger in a zoo in New York City that seems to have gotten COVID-19 from its caretakers. To be safe, wash your hands before and after touching animals. Until we know more, if you have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and have a pet or other animal, you should:1. Avoid close contact with them. Do not snuggle or kiss them, let them lick you, sit on your lap, or sleep in your bed. 2. Avoid coughing and sneezing on your animals. Cover your coughs and sneezes. 3. Have another member of your household care for your animals, if you can. 4. If it's not possible to have someone else care for your animal, always wash your hands before touching or feeding them. 5.

If you experience a medical emergency such as trouble breathing, call 911 and let the operator know you may have COVID-19. For severe illness, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.Â  Currently there are no FDA-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of COVID-19. Researchers are studying new drugs, and drugs that are already approved for other health conditions, as possible treatments for COVID-19. The FDA is working with drug manufacturers, researchers, and other partners to accelerate the development process for COVID-19 treatments. CDC has more information for health care providers about these potential treatments. Never take a prescription medicine or drug if it is not prescribed for you by your doctor for your health condition.	episode_done:True
text: How do I treat coronavirus?	labels: In the lab, these drugs have been shown to prevent the growth of the virus that causes COVID-19. There are a few reports of patients with COVID-19 who received these drugs and improved. Some are reports of groups of patients, all of whom received the drug. It is not known whether it was the drug that led to the improvement or whether there were other factors involved. We do not know if the treated patientsâ condition would have improved without the drug. To know this, there would have to be a group of similar patients who did not receive the drug (control). Because chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine may possibly help very sick patients, FDA is allowing these drugs to be provided to certain hospitalized patients under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) issued March 28, 2020. Â Under the EUA, health care providers and patients are provided with information about the risks of these drugs. However, more data from clinical trials are necessary for us to determine whether chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate are safe and effective in treating or preventing COVID-19.	episode_done:True

text: I have Hashimoto s hypothyroiditis Am I more at risk I also had a PE due to Fv leiden and oral contraceptives in 2001 what do you recommend I do?	labels: Social distancing helps to reduce the chance of infecting people who are more likely to get severe disease. It helps to stop the virus from spreading quickly. This also helps to prevent there being too many sick people for hospitals to handle.	episode_done:True
text: I have Hashimoto s hypothyroiditis Am I more at risk I also had a PE due to Fv leiden and oral contraceptives in 2001 what do you recommend I do?	labels: Staying at home and using "social distancing" helps stop the virus from spreading quickly. This helps to reduce the burden on healthcare systems, as there are not enough hospital workers and beds if too many people get sick at once.Social distancing means staying farther away from other people and avoiding groups of people. Since COVID-19 mostly spreads from person-to-person interactions, staying at least 6 feet away from other people can help stop the spread. It is important to use social distancing because people can spread COVID-19 even if they feel fine. It is especially important to use social distancing to protect people who are more likely to get very sick from the disease.	episode_done:True
text: How does COVID 19 affect asymptomatic people s lungs?	labels: COVID-19 can spread in a few different ways. It can spread from person to person if you inhale an infected person's respiratory droplets when they sneezes, coughs, or talk. It can also spead if you touch something that an infected person has touched, like a door knob, elevator button, or bathroom faucet.That's why it's important to wash your hands, avoid touching your face, and practice social distancing to avoid getting sick. That's why it's also important to self-isolate and wear a mask around other household members if you are sick to avoid infecting other people.	episode_done:True
text: How does COVID 19 affect asymptomatic people s lungs?	labels: People can fight stigma by providing social support in situations where you notice this is occurring. Stigma affects the emotional or  mental health  of stigmatized groups and the communities they live in. Stopping stigma is important to making communities and community members resilient. See  resources on mental health and coping during COVID-19 . Everyone can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by  knowing the facts  and sharing them with others in your community.	episode_done:True
text: How does COVID 19 affect asymptomatic people s lungs?	labels: In the lab, these drugs have been shown to prevent the growth of the virus that causes COVID-19. There are a few reports of patients with COVID-19 who received these drugs and improved. Some are reports of groups of patients, all of whom received the drug. It is not known whether it was the drug that led to the improvement or whether there were other factors involved. We do not know if the treated patientsâ condition would have improved without the drug. To know this, there would have to be a group of similar patients who did not receive the drug (control). Because chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine may possibly help very sick patients, FDA is allowing these drugs to be provided to certain hospitalized patients under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) issued March 28, 2020. Â Under the EUA, health care providers and patients are provided with information about the risks of these drugs. However, more data from clinical trials are necessary for us to determine whether chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate are safe and effective in treating or preventing COVID-19.	episode_done:True
text: How does COVID 19 affect asymptomatic people s lungs?	labels: Together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19 by making a conscious effort to keep a physical distance between each other. Physical (social) distancing is proven to be one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of illness during an outbreak. This means making changes in your everyday routines to minimize close contact with others, including:avoiding crowded places and non-essential gatherings avoiding common greetings, such as handshakes limiting contact with people at higher risk like older adults and those in poor health keeping a distance of at least 2 arms-length (approximately 2 metres) from others	episode_done:True

text: what are the symptoms of covid 19 by day of infection?	labels: SARS-COV-2 is the name for the virus that causes the disease known as "COVID-19." Let's break it down."SARS" stands for "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome", meaning that it can cause serious problems with breathing and the lungs."COV" stands for "Coronavirus." This is the type of virus that causes COVID-19. The "2" is a way to say that this virus is different than the SARS virus that caused an outbreak in 2002-2003.	episode_done:True
text: what are the symptoms of covid 19 by day of infection?	labels: People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. People with mild symptoms are able to recover at home. If you experience a medical emergency such as trouble breathing, call 911 and let the operator know you may have COVID-19. For severe illness, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.Â  Currently there are no FDA-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of COVID-19. Researchers are studying new drugs, and drugs that are already approved for other health conditions, as possible treatments for COVID-19. The FDA is working with drug manufacturers, researchers, and other partners to accelerate the development process for COVID-19 treatments. CDC has more information for health care providers about these potential treatments. Never take a prescription medicine or drug if it is not prescribed for you by your doctor for your health condition.	episode_done:True
text: How long does the virus remain on a surface?	labels: Current thinking is that COVID-19 mostly spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets. But some studies show that the virus can last on surfaces, so it is possible that someone could get the virus by touching a surface that has the virus on it and then touching their mouth, nose, or eyes.	episode_done:True
text: How long does the virus remain on a surface?	labels: A recent study shows that the virus can live in the air and on surfaces from several hours to several days. On plastic, it can live for up to 72 hours (3 days). On stainless steel, it can live for up to 48 hours (2 days). On cardboard, it can live up to 24 hours (1 day). On copper, it can live up to four hours. It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID-19 from these surfaces.  It is still important to regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces as well as packages and mail that come through. Remember to wash your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol based hand sanitizer (60%).	episode_done:True
text: How long does the virus remain on a surface?	labels: How long you should be isolated for varies on a case-by-case basis.

Health care providers are encouraged to order a test for any child or adult who is showing symptoms of COVID-19, even if their symptoms are mild.	episode_done:True
text: Should I use NSAIDs?	labels: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others. If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time.

text: Is it true that you can get the virus again even after you ve recovered?	labels: Social distancing means maintaining a physical distance (approximately 6 feet or 2 meters) from others you do not live with. This includes when you're inside a store or outside for exercise. The COVID-19 virus spreads easily from person-to-person. It travels through the air when a sick person coughs, sneezes or talks. One way to contain the spread of COVID-19 is to stop people from sharing it. Without a vaccine or treatment, we can help contain the virus by: Staying at home to protect others if you are sick. Staying home is still the best way to lower our risk of COVID-19, but small groups of 10 or fewer people are now allowed if health and safety precautions are followed. Learn how to safely connect with friends and family. Continuing to go outside, take walks, do essential errands while maintaining a physical distance from others and practicing proper hygiene. Remember that ticks are active this time of year. Find out how to Be Tick Smart and prevent tick bites. Wearing a cloth face mask or covering in public settings when a physical distance of at least 6 feet is difficult to maintain, especially at the grocery store, pharmacy, doctorÃ¢ÂÂs office, hospital or other essential business or office, and on a crowded sidewalk or bike path. Washing your hands (adults and children) any time you go inside, before you eat, and before you spend time with people who are more vulnerable to the effects of COVID-19.	episode_done:True

text: Is it true that you can get the virus again even after you ve recovered?	labels: âCurrently, there is no evidence that COVID-19 can spread through contact with imported goods. There have been no cases of COVID-19 in the United States associated with imported goods. Other coronaviruses do not survive well on surfaces. So, experts think the risk of spread from products or packages shipped over days or weeks is extremely low. Coronaviruses spread most often by small droplets of mucus from the nose and throat.	episode_done:True
text: Is it true that you can get the virus again even after you ve recovered?	labels: If you are having symptoms of COVID-19, call your health care provider for a referral. If you do not have a health care provider, call 2-1-1 to be connected with a local community or hospital-connected clinic for a referral to a test site. If you are having a medical emergency, call 9-1-1 or go to the hospital. Health care providers are encouraged to order a test for any child or adult who is showing symptoms of COVID-19, even if their symptoms are mild. Find out what to do if you are sick from the CDC and what to do while youÃ¢ÂÂre waiting for test results. Pop-up Testing Sites Any Vermonter without symptoms can be tested at a pop-up testing site without a doctorÃ¢ÂÂs referral. This includes people who work in Vermont, second homeowners, and college students. Registration for testing is required. For people who do not have internet access and want to register at a pop-up site, they can call 2-1-1 for help with registration. Register for a pop-up testing site. The test is a nasopharyngeal swab, or NP swab, where a health care professional uses a swab to collect a sample from the back of the nose and throat. This test will tell you if you have a current infection. It is not a serology/antibody test, which means it will not tell you if you were infected in the past. The following groups are encouraged to get tested at pop-up sites: health care workers, first responders (EMS, fire, and law enforcement), child care providers currently serving essential workers, and anyone currently under quarantine who has had no symptoms during the first seven days of quarantine.

text: Do I need a mask?	labels: Staying at home and using "social distancing" helps stop the virus from spreading quickly. This helps to reduce the burden on healthcare systems, as there are not enough hospital workers and beds if too many people get sick at once.Social distancing means staying farther away from other people and avoiding groups of people. Since COVID-19 mostly spreads from person-to-person interactions, staying at least 6 feet away from other people can help stop the spread. It is important to use social distancing because people can spread COVID-19 even if they feel fine. It is especially important to use social distancing to protect people who are more likely to get very sick from the disease.	episode_done:True
text: How long will social distancing measures last?	labels: Together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19 by making a conscious effort to keep a physical distance between each other. Physical (social) distancing is proven to be one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of illness during an outbreak. This means making changes in your everyday routines to minimize close contact with others, including:avoiding crowded places and non-essential gatherings avoiding common greetings, such as handshakes limiting contact with people at higher risk like older adults and those in poor health keeping a distance of at least 2 arms-length (approximately 2 metres) from others	episode_done:True
text: How long will social distancing measures last?	labels: Social distancing means maintaining a physical distance (approximately 6 feet or 2 meters) from others you do not live with. This includes when you're inside a store or outside for exercise. The COVID-19 virus spreads easily from person-to-person. It travels through the air when a sick person coughs, sneezes or talks. One way to contain the spread of COVID-19 is to stop people from sharing it. Without a vaccine or treatment, we can help contain the virus by: Staying at home to protect others if you are sick. Staying home is still the best way to lower our risk of COVID-19, but small groups of 10 or fewer people are now allowed if health and safety precautions are followed. Learn how to safely connect with friends and family. Continuing to go outside, take walks, do essential errands while maintaining a physical distance from others and practicing proper hygiene. Remember that ticks are active this time of year. Find out how to Be Tick Smart and prevent tick bites. Wearing a cloth face mask or covering in public settings when a physical distance of at least 6 feet is difficult to maintain, especially at the grocery store, pharmacy, doctorÃ¢ÂÂs office, hospital or other essential business or office, and on a crowded sidewalk or bike path.

text: How long will social distancing measures last?	labels: How long you should be isolated for varies on a case-by-case basis. If you have been sick with COVID-19 and have been in isolation, you should talk to your healthcare provider to decide when you can be released from isolation. Your doctor will look for signs that:-You are fever-free without taking fever-reducing medication -You no longer show symptoms -Sometimes, your doctor might recommend testing respiratory samples to decide if you can be released from isolationOnce you have been released from isolation, then you are no longer considered to be likely to infect other people.	episode_done:True
text: How long will social distancing measures last?	labels: A recent study shows that the virus can live in the air and on surfaces from several hours to several days. On plastic, it can live for up to 72 hours (3 days). On stainless steel, it can live for up to 48 hours (2 days). On cardboard, it can live up to 24 hours (1 day). On copper, it can live up to four hours. It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID-19 from these surfaces.  It is still important to regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces as well as packages and mail that come through. Remember to wash your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol based hand sanitizer (60%).	episode_done:True

text: If I traveled from Vancouver to quebec city do i need to quaratine?	labels: Staying at home and using "social distancing" helps stop the virus from spreading quickly. This helps to reduce the burden on healthcare systems, as there are not enough hospital workers and beds if too many people get sick at once.Social distancing means staying farther away from other people and avoiding groups of people. Since COVID-19 mostly spreads from person-to-person interactions, staying at least 6 feet away from other people can help stop the spread. It is important to use social distancing because people can spread COVID-19 even if they feel fine. It is especially important to use social distancing to protect people who are more likely to get very sick from the disease.	episode_done:True
text: If I traveled from Vancouver to quebec city do i need to quaratine?	labels: If you are high risk and there is an outbreak near you, you should: 1. Stay home as much as you can2.

text: what are cov19 symptoms?	labels: Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. There are different types of coronaviruses.Some types of coronavirus are more common in people and some versions are more common in animals. Rarely, a type of the virus that was common in animals can spread to people. "Coronavirus Disease 2019â (which is shortened to "COVID-19") is an example of a type of coronavirus that has recently spread to humans.	episode_done:True
text: what are cov19 symptoms?	labels: COVID-19 is a disease caused by a new type of virus. Sometimes people also call it "coronavirus," which is is the type of virus that causes COVID-19. COVID-19 causes some symptoms that are like getting a cold or flu. But some people get worse symptoms and need more care. COVID-19 is caused by a new type of virus that our body has not seen before. Since our body has not seen it before, our immune system has to learn how to fight off this new virus.	episode_done:True
text: how many people died so far?	labels: How long you should be isolated for varies on a case-by-case basis. If you have been sick with COVID-19 and have been in isolation, you should talk to your healthcare provider to decide when you can be released from isolation. Your doctor will look for signs that:-You are fever-free without taking fever-reducing medication -You no longer show symptoms -Sometimes, your doctor might recommend testing respiratory samples to decide if you can be released from isolationOnce you have been released from isolation, then you are no longer considered to be likely to infect other people.	episode_done:True

text: If you recover from the virus can you still be a carrier?	labels: âCurrently, there is no evidence that COVID-19 can spread through contact with imported goods. There have been no cases of COVID-19 in the United States associated with imported goods. Other coronaviruses do not survive well on surfaces. So, experts think the risk of spread from products or packages shipped over days or weeks is extremely low. Coronaviruses spread most often by small droplets of mucus from the nose and throat.	episode_done:True
text: If you recover from the virus can you still be a carrier?	labels: If you don't have access to hand sanitizer, soap and water are always the best option.Make sure any hand santizer you have has at least 60% alcohol, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Any hand sanitizer that has less than 60% alcohol will not be effective at killing the virus.	episode_done:True
text: If you recover from the virus can you still be a carrier?	labels: You can protect your child by having them wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and avoid people who are sick. They should also stay away from people outside your home. This means you should avoid playdates, playing on public playgrounds, or being physically close to friends.You should also clean and disinfect surfaces that you touch a lot in household common areas like tables, chairs, and doorknobs. Wash clothes and plush toys frequently.	episode_done:True
text: If you recover from the virus can you still be a carrier?	labels: Right now, we don't know of any clear cases of the virus passing from people to their pets. There was a tiger in a zoo in New York City that seems to have gotten COVID-19 from its caretakers. To be safe, wash your hands before and after touching animals. Until we know more, if you have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and have a pet or other animal, you should:1. Avoid close contact with them. Do not snuggle or kiss them, let them lick you, sit on your lap, or sleep in your bed. 2. Avoid coughing and sneezing on your animals. Cover your coughs and sneezes. 3. Have another member of your household care for your animals, if you can. 4. If it's not possible to have someone else care for your animal, always wash your hands before touching or feeding them. 5. Limit your animal's contact with other people and animals. Tthis may mean keeping them indoors.We might learn more about human to animal spread in the future. Talk to your pet's doctor if you are worried about your pet's health.	episode_done:True

text: If I contract the virus does wearing a mask prevent others getting infected?	labels: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others. If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time.

text: How contagious is the virus?	labels: COVID-19 is contagious and it is actively spreading from person to person. The CDC recommends that those who have COVID-19 are isolated either at a hospital or at home, depending on how sick they are, until they are no longer at risk of infecting others.	episode_done:True
text: How contagious is the virus?	labels: A recent study shows that the virus can live in the air and on surfaces from several hours to several days. On plastic, it can live for up to 72 hours (3 days). On stainless steel, it can live for up to 48 hours (2 days). On cardboard, it can live up to 24 hours (1 day). On copper, it can live up to four hours. It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID-19 from these surfaces.  It is still important to regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces as well as packages and mail that come through. Remember to wash your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol based hand sanitizer (60%).	episode_done:True

If you experience a medical emergency such as trouble breathing, call 911 and let the operator know you may have COVID-19. For severe illness, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.Â  Currently there are no FDA-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of COVID-19. Researchers are studying new drugs, and drugs that are already approved for other health conditions, as possible treatments for COVID-19. The FDA is working with drug manufacturers, researchers, and other partners to accelerate the development process for COVID-19 treatments. CDC has more information for health care providers about these potential treatments.

text: What s the difference between COVID 19 and CoronaVirus?	labels: You need to self-isolate if you have been confirmed to have COVID-19. Isolation is a health care term that means keeping infected people away from those who are not infected. If you have been asked to self-isolate, you should:-Stay at home except to get medical care -Stay away from other people in your home as much as you can -Wear a face mask if you need to be around other people (for example, in a doctor's office) -Cover your coughs and sneezes -Wash your hands frequently -Continue to monitor your symptoms until your doctor says you don't need to be in isolation any moreQuarantine means staying away from other people because you might have been exposed to the virus. For COVID-19, people should quarantine for at least 14 days, or 2 weeks from the time they might have had contact with someone with COVID-19. That's because most people who get COVID-19 would have symptoms within 14 days. Scientists think that people are not likely to spread COVID-19 to others if they do not get sick after 14 days.	episode_done:True
text: What s the difference between COVID 19 and CoronaVirus?	labels: The difference between self-monitoring and self-isolation is based on whether you have been diagnosed with COVID-19 or not. If you may have been exposed to COVID-19 but don't have symptoms, you should self-monitor. If you have been diagnosed with COVID-19, you should self-isolate.You need to self-monitor if you have no symptoms but may have been exposed to COVID-19 in the last 14 days or are in close contact with older adults, people who are medically vulnerable or have been asked to do so by your Public Health Authority. Self-monitoring means you should:-Monitor yourself for 14 days for symptoms like fever, cough, and trouble breathing -Stay at home -Avoid crowded places -Stay at least 6 feet away from others as much as you can -Wash your hands frequentlyYou need to self-isolate if you have been confirmed to have COVID-19. Isolation means keeping infected people away from those who are not infected. If you have been asked to self-isolate, you should:-Stay home except to get medical care -Stay away from other people in your home as much as you can -Wear a face mask if you need to be around other people (for example, in a doctor's office) -Cover your coughs and sneezes -Wash your hands frequently -Keep checking your symptoms until your doctor says you don't need to be in isolation any more	episode_done:True
text: What s the difference between COVID 19 and CoronaVirus?	labels: COVID-19 is a disease caused by a new type of virus. Sometimes people also call it "coronavirus," which is is the type of virus that causes COVID-19. COVID-19 causes some symptoms that are like getting a cold or flu. But some people get worse symptoms and need more care. COVID-19 is caused by a new type of virus that our body has not seen before. Since our body has not seen it before, our immune system has to learn how to fight off this new virus.	episode_done:True
text: What s the difference between COVID 19 and CoronaVirus?	labels: SARS-COV-2 is the name for the virus that causes the disease known as "COVID-19." Let's break it down."SARS" stands for "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome", meaning that it can cause serious problems with breathing and the lungs."COV" stands for "Coronavirus." This is the type of virus that causes COVID-19. The "2" is a way to say that this virus is different than the SARS virus that caused an outbreak in 2002-2003.	episode_done:True
text: What are the symptoms?	labels: Those who are infected with COVID-19 may have little to no symptoms. You may not know you have symptoms of COVID-19 because they are similar to a cold or flu. Symptoms haveincluded:cough fever difficulty breathing pneumonia in both lungsIn severe cases, infection can leadto death.Symptoms may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to COVID-19. This is the longest known incubation period for this disease.Recent evidence indicates that the virus can be transmitted to othersfrom someone who is infected but not showing symptoms. This includes peoplewho:have not yet developed symptoms (pre-symptomatic) never develop symptoms (asymptomatic)While experts know that these kinds of transmissions are happening amongthose in close contact or in close physical settings, it is not known to whatextent. This means it is extremely important to follow the proven preventative measures.Think you might have COVID-19? Take a self-assessment	episode_done:True
text: What are the symptoms?	labels: Children and adults have the same COVID-19 symptoms, although children might not get as sick as adults. Children might get a fever, runny nose, or cough. Some children have had vomiting or diarrhea. We are still learning about how COVID-19 affects children.	episode_done:True
text: What are the symptoms?	labels: People might be able to spread the disease before people realize they are sick. But most scientists think that people are most likely to infect others when they have symptoms and feel sick.

text: What are the symptoms?	labels: Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. There are different types of coronaviruses.Some types of coronavirus are more common in people and some versions are more common in animals. Rarely, a type of the virus that was common in animals can spread to people. "Coronavirus Disease 2019â (which is shortened to "COVID-19") is an example of a type of coronavirus that has recently spread to humans.	episode_done:True

text: Is it useful to wear a mask if we are not sick?	labels: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others. If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time. That is because there are not enough of these masks for health care workers. Health care workers need these masks to stay safe and to take care of sick patients. If you have extra surgical or N95 masks, please donate them to your local healthcare facility.	episode_done:True
text: Is it useful to wear a mask if we are not sick?	labels: Children under the age of 2 years should not wear any type of masks. Because babies' airways are smaller, breathing through a mask is even harder on them and they are more likely to suffocate if they use a mask. Older infants or young toddlers are not likely to keep the mask on and will likely try to remove it. This will mean they are touching their face more and could infect themselves with the virus. It is safest to keep children at home and follow social distancing.	episode_done:True
text: Is it useful to wear a mask if we are not sick?	labels: CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public when other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission of the coronavirus. The purpose of wearing cloth face coverings in public is to slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others.Â Read more about types of face masks and FDAâs emergency use authorization for non-surgical face masks.	episode_done:True

text: Is it useful to wear a mask if we are not sick?	labels: Fewer children seem to get infected by the coronavirus than adults, and most of those who do contract it have mild symptoms, if any.A very small number of children with the virus have shown symptoms associated with toxic shock or Kawasaki disease. This is a rare illness in children, according to the New York City Health Department, that involves inflammation of the blood vessels, including coronary arteries. Two studies conducted in recent weeks offer compelling evidence that children can transmit the virus. While neither proved it, many epidemiologists who were not involved in the research said that the evidence was strong enough to suggest that schools should be kept closed for now.

text: How many cases in Quebec?	labels: COVID-19 can spread in a few different ways. It can spread from person to person if you inhale an infected person's respiratory droplets when they sneezes, coughs, or talk. It can also spead if you touch something that an infected person has touched, like a door knob, elevator button, or bathroom faucet.That's why it's important to wash your hands, avoid touching your face, and practice social distancing to avoid getting sick. That's why it's also important to self-isolate and wear a mask around other household members if you are sick to avoid infecting other people.	episode_done:True
text: How many cases in Quebec?	labels: How long you should be isolated for varies on a case-by-case basis. If you have been sick with COVID-19 and have been in isolation, you should talk to your healthcare provider to decide when you can be released from isolation. Your doctor will look for signs that:-You are fever-free without taking fever-reducing medication -You no longer show symptoms -Sometimes, your doctor might recommend testing respiratory samples to decide if you can be released from isolationOnce you have been released from isolation, then you are no longer considered to be likely to infect other people.	episode_done:True
text: I am coughing but I don t have fever Could I have covid 19?	labels: The risk of COVID-19 spreading from products or packaging shipped over a period of days or weeks is likely to be low. Currently, there is no evidence that COVID-19 has been spread from imported goods.	episode_done:True
text: I am coughing but I don t have fever Could I have covid 19?	labels: Generally, do not touch the body of someone who has died of COVID-19. We are still learning how COVID-19 spreads and if a deceased body can transmit the virus. One could get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it, and then touching their face (like their mouth, nose, or eyes). Try to avoid kissing washing, and shrouding the body. If washing and shrouding the body are important in your culture or religion, work with your community cultural and religious leaders as well as funeral home staff to try to reduce exposure as much as possible. People who conduct these activities should wear disposable gloves. If fluid splashing is expected, more personal protective equipment may be needed, such as disposable gowns, goggles, and face masks.	episode_done:True
text: I am coughing but I don t have fever Could I have covid 19?	labels: Pregnant women should do the same things as everyone else to avoid COVID-19 infection, including: Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, you can use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Clean and disinfect frequently-touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash and wash your hands. Stay home when you are sick. When you must go out, practice social distancing.	episode_done:True

text: I am coughing but I don t have fever Could I have covid 19?	labels: Because COVID-19 is a new disease, we are still learning how it affects pregnant women. At this time, there isÂ no evidence to suggest that pregnant women are at a greater risk for more serious outcomes related to COVID-19 or that their developing child could be negatively affected by COVID-19. You can protect yourself from becoming ill by taking the following precautions:stay homeÂ as much as possible, except for important medical appointments talk to your doctor, obstetrician or midwifeÂ about the possibility of telephone or videoconference appointments avoid unnecessary visitorsÂ to your home wash your handsÂ often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds use alcohol-basedÂ hand sanitizerÂ if soap and water are not available practiseÂ physical distancingÂ by keeping a distance of at least 2 metres from others avoid touchingÂ your mouth, nose and eyes avoid crowded places and peak-hours make limited trips to the store for essentials avoid travel by public transitFor more information, refer to ourÂ advice for motherson pregnancy, childbirth and caring for newborns.

text: How long does the virus stay airborne?	labels: A recent study shows that the virus can live in the air and on surfaces from several hours to several days. On plastic, it can live for up to 72 hours (3 days). On stainless steel, it can live for up to 48 hours (2 days). On cardboard, it can live up to 24 hours (1 day). On copper, it can live up to four hours. It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID-19 from these surfaces.  It is still important to regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces as well as packages and mail that come through. Remember to wash your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol based hand sanitizer (60%).	episode_done:True
text: How long does the virus stay airborne?	labels: Staying at home and using "social distancing" helps stop the virus from spreading quickly. This helps to reduce the burden on healthcare systems, as there are not enough hospital workers and beds if too many people get sick at once.Social distancing means staying farther away from other people and avoiding groups of people. Since COVID-19 mostly spreads from person-to-person interactions, staying at least 6 feet away from other people can help stop the spread. It is important to use social distancing because people can spread COVID-19 even if they feel fine. It is especially important to use social distancing to protect people who are more likely to get very sick from the disease.	episode_done:True

Physical (social) distancing is proven to be one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of illness during an outbreak. This means making changes in your everyday routines to minimize close contact with others, including:avoiding crowded places and non-essential gatherings avoiding common greetings, such as handshakes limiting contact with people at higher risk like older adults and those in poor health keeping a distance of at least 2 arms-length (approximately 2 metres) from others	episode_done:True

text: If someone was infected once can they be reinfected Can they still carry the virus and infect others?	labels: COVID-19 is contagious and it is actively spreading from person to person. The CDC recommends that those who have COVID-19 are isolated either at a hospital or at home, depending on how sick they are, until they are no longer at risk of infecting others.	episode_done:True
text: If someone was infected once can they be reinfected Can they still carry the virus and infect others?	labels: Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease. Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure. For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days. Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period.	episode_done:True
text: If someone was infected once can they be reinfected Can they still carry the virus and infect others?	labels: Try to avoid all unnecessary travel at this time. If it is essential to travel, try to avoid contact with sick passengers, mantain as much distance as possible from other passengers, avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. You should also wear a cloth face covering while at the airport and on the plane.	episode_done:True
text: If someone was infected once can they be reinfected Can they still carry the virus and infect others?	labels: Right now, we don't know of any higher risk due to being in the same room at a funeral or visitation service with the body of someone who has died of COVID-19 as long as you stay 6 feet (2 meters) away. That being said, for now we must all avoid large gatherings and stay at home as much as we can to reduce the spread of COVID-19.	episode_done:True

text: What are the symptoms of Covid 19?	labels: Those who are infected with COVID-19 may have little to no symptoms. You may not know you have symptoms of COVID-19 because they are similar to a cold or flu. Symptoms haveincluded:cough fever difficulty breathing pneumonia in both lungsIn severe cases, infection can leadto death.Symptoms may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to COVID-19. This is the longest known incubation period for this disease.Recent evidence indicates that the virus can be transmitted to othersfrom someone who is infected but not showing symptoms. This includes peoplewho:have not yet developed symptoms (pre-symptomatic) never develop symptoms (asymptomatic)While experts know that these kinds of transmissions are happening amongthose in close contact or in close physical settings, it is not known to whatextent. This means it is extremely important to follow the proven preventative measures.Think you might have COVID-19? Take a self-assessment	episode_done:True
text: What are the symptoms of Covid 19?	labels: COVID-19 is a disease caused by a new type of virus. Sometimes people also call it "coronavirus," which is is the type of virus that causes COVID-19. COVID-19 causes some symptoms that are like getting a cold or flu. But some people get worse symptoms and need more care. COVID-19 is caused by a new type of virus that our body has not seen before. Since our body has not seen it before, our immune system has to learn how to fight off this new virus.	episode_done:True
text: What are the symptoms of Covid 19?	labels: Children and adults have the same COVID-19 symptoms, although children might not get as sick as adults. Children might get a fever, runny nose, or cough. Some children have had vomiting or diarrhea. We are still learning about how COVID-19 affects children.	episode_done:True
text: What are the symptoms of Covid 19?	labels: SARS-COV-2 is the name for the virus that causes the disease known as "COVID-19." Let's break it down."SARS" stands for "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome", meaning that it can cause serious problems with breathing and the lungs."COV" stands for "Coronavirus." This is the type of virus that causes COVID-19. The "2" is a way to say that this virus is different than the SARS virus that caused an outbreak in 2002-2003.	episode_done:True
text: What are the symptoms of Covid 19?	labels: People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. People with mild symptoms are able to recover at home. If you experience a medical emergency such as trouble breathing, call 911 and let the operator know you may have COVID-19. For severe illness, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.Â  Currently there are no FDA-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of COVID-19. Researchers are studying new drugs, and drugs that are already approved for other health conditions, as possible treatments for COVID-19. The FDA is working with drug manufacturers, researchers, and other partners to accelerate the development process for COVID-19 treatments. CDC has more information for health care providers about these potential treatments. Never take a prescription medicine or drug if it is not prescribed for you by your doctor for your health condition.	episode_done:True
text: How does it spread?	labels: COVID-19 can spread in a few different ways. It can spread from person to person if you inhale an infected person's respiratory droplets when they sneezes, coughs, or talk. It can also spead if you touch something that an infected person has touched, like a door knob, elevator button, or bathroom faucet.That's why it's important to wash your hands, avoid touching your face, and practice social distancing to avoid getting sick. That's why it's also important to self-isolate and wear a mask around other household members if you are sick to avoid infecting other people.	episode_done:True
text: How does it spread?	labels: Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.	episode_done:True
text: How does it spread?	labels: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others. If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time. That is because there are not enough of these masks for health care workers. Health care workers need these masks to stay safe and to take care of sick patients. If you have extra surgical or N95 masks, please donate them to your local healthcare facility.	episode_done:True
text: How does it spread?	labels: Current thinking is that COVID-19 mostly spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets. But some studies show that the virus can last on surfaces, so it is possible that someone could get the virus by touching a surface that has the virus on it and then touching their mouth, nose, or eyes.	episode_done:True
text: How does it spread?	labels: Together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19 by making a conscious effort to keep a physical distance between each other. Physical (social) distancing is proven to be one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of illness during an outbreak. This means making changes in your everyday routines to minimize close contact with others, including:avoiding crowded places and non-essential gatherings avoiding common greetings, such as handshakes limiting contact with people at higher risk like older adults and those in poor health keeping a distance of at least 2 arms-length (approximately 2 metres) from others	episode_done:True
text: Where did COVID 19 come from?	labels: COVID-19 is a virus strain, first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, that has only spread in people since December 2019. Health experts are closely monitoring the situation because little is known about this new virus and it has the potential to cause severe illness and pneumonia in some people.	episode_done:True
text: Where did COVID 19 come from?	labels: If you are having symptoms of COVID-19, call your health care provider for a referral. If you do not have a health care provider, call 2-1-1 to be connected with a local community or hospital-connected clinic for a referral to a test site. If you are having a medical emergency, call 9-1-1 or go to the hospital. Health care providers are encouraged to order a test for any child or adult who is showing symptoms of COVID-19, even if their symptoms are mild. Find out what to do if you are sick from the CDC and what to do while youÃ¢ÂÂre waiting for test results. Pop-up Testing Sites Any Vermonter without symptoms can be tested at a pop-up testing site without a doctorÃ¢ÂÂs referral. This includes people who work in Vermont, second homeowners, and college students. Registration for testing is required. For people who do not have internet access and want to register at a pop-up site, they can call 2-1-1 for help with registration. Register for a pop-up testing site. The test is a nasopharyngeal swab, or NP swab, where a health care professional uses a swab to collect a sample from the back of the nose and throat. This test will tell you if you have a current infection. It is not a serology/antibody test, which means it will not tell you if you were infected in the past. The following groups are encouraged to get tested at pop-up sites: health care workers, first responders (EMS, fire, and law enforcement), child care providers currently serving essential workers, and anyone currently under quarantine who has had no symptoms during the first seven days of quarantine. Find more details under Ã¢ÂÂI am under a 14-day quarantine. Can I have the option to be tested and end my quarantine period?Ã¢ÂÂ on this page.	episode_done:True
text: Where did COVID 19 come from?	labels: You could be at higher risk of catching COVID-19 if many people have gotten COVID-19 near where you live. You could also have a higher risk if you visit places where many people are getting sick with COVID-19.Right now, in most places, the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low.

On copper, it can live up to four hours. It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID-19 from these surfaces.  It is still important to regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces as well as packages and mail that come through.

This means making changes in your everyday routines to minimize close contact with others, including:avoiding crowded places and non-essential gatherings avoiding common greetings, such as handshakes limiting contact with people at higher risk like older adults and those in poor health keeping a distance of at least 2 arms-length (approximately 2 metres) from others	episode_done:True
text: How long does the virus live on surfaces?	labels: Self-isolation means that people who are sick stay away from those who are not sick. This helps to keep the disease from spreading. If someone has asked you to self-isolate, you should:-Stay at home except to get medical care -Stay away from other people in your home as much as you can -Wear a face mask if you have to be around other people (for example, in a doctor's office) -Cover your coughs and sneezes -Wash your hands a lot -Keep track of your symptomsGo here to read more about how you should self-isolate, visit this page: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html	episode_done:True
text: If I am starting to breath heavily should I get it checked out?	labels: Because COVID-19 is a new disease, we are still learning how it affects pregnant women. At this time, there isÂ no evidence to suggest that pregnant women are at a greater risk for more serious outcomes related to COVID-19 or that their developing child could be negatively affected by COVID-19. You can protect yourself from becoming ill by taking the following precautions:stay homeÂ as much as possible, except for important medical appointments talk to your doctor, obstetrician or midwifeÂ about the possibility of telephone or videoconference appointments avoid unnecessary visitorsÂ to your home wash your handsÂ often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds use alcohol-basedÂ hand sanitizerÂ if soap and water are not available practiseÂ physical distancingÂ by keeping a distance of at least 2 metres from others avoid touchingÂ your mouth, nose and eyes avoid crowded places and peak-hours make limited trips to the store for essentials avoid travel by public transitFor more information, refer to ourÂ advice for motherson pregnancy, childbirth and caring for newborns. If you are pregnant and concerned about COVID-19, speak to your health care provider.	episode_done:True
text: If I am starting to breath heavily should I get it checked out?	labels: The risk of COVID-19 spreading from products or packaging shipped over a period of days or weeks is likely to be low. Currently, there is no evidence that COVID-19 has been spread from imported goods.	episode_done:True
text: If I am starting to breath heavily should I get it checked out?	labels: If you are having symptoms of COVID-19, call your health care provider to be tested. If you do not have a health care provider, call 2-1-1 to be connected with a local community or hospital-connected clinic for referral to a test site. Health care providers are encouraged to order a test for any child or adult who is showing symptoms of COVID-19, even if their symptoms are mild.	episode_done:True
text: If I am starting to breath heavily should I get it checked out?	labels: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others. If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time. That is because there are not enough of these masks for health care workers. Health care workers need these masks to stay safe and to take care of sick patients. If you have extra surgical or N95 masks, please donate them to your local healthcare facility.	episode_done:True
text: If I am starting to breath heavily should I get it checked out?	labels: Pregnant women should do the same things as everyone else to avoid COVID-19 infection, including: Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, you can use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Clean and disinfect frequently-touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash and wash your hands. Stay home when you are sick. When you must go out, practice social distancing.	episode_done:True

We are still learning how COVID-19 spreads and if a deceased body can transmit the virus. One could get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it, and then touching their face (like their mouth, nose, or eyes). Try to avoid kissing washing, and shrouding the body. If washing and shrouding the body are important in your culture or religion, work with your community cultural and religious leaders as well as funeral home staff to try to reduce exposure as much as possible. People who conduct these activities should wear disposable gloves. If fluid splashing is expected, more personal protective equipment may be needed, such as disposable gowns, goggles, and face masks.	episode_done:True
text: how many people have died?	labels: Right now, we don't know of any higher risk due to being in the same room at a funeral or visitation service with the body of someone who has died of COVID-19 as long as you stay 6 feet (2 meters) away. That being said, for now we must all avoid large gatherings and stay at home as much as we can to reduce the spread of COVID-19.	episode_done:True

text: For how long COVID-19 can stay alive on different surfaces?	labels: Staying at home and using "social distancing" helps stop the virus from spreading quickly. This helps to reduce the burden on healthcare systems, as there are not enough hospital workers and beds if too many people get sick at once.Social distancing means staying farther away from other people and avoiding groups of people. Since COVID-19 mostly spreads from person-to-person interactions, staying at least 6 feet away from other people can help stop the spread. It is important to use social distancing because people can spread COVID-19 even if they feel fine. It is especially important to use social distancing to protect people who are more likely to get very sick from the disease.	episode_done:True

Scientists are still studying how long coronavirus lives on surfaces. In general, you should practice good hygiene and food safety practices. This means cleaning surfaces that are used a lot, cleaning your fruits and vegetables, and cooking meats well. Wash your hands with soap and water before handling food.	episode_done:True
text: I am 43 What s the chance of my survival if I get covid?	labels: Because COVID-19 is a new disease, we are still learning how it affects pregnant women. At this time, there isÂ no evidence to suggest that pregnant women are at a greater risk for more serious outcomes related to COVID-19 or that their developing child could be negatively affected by COVID-19. You can protect yourself from becoming ill by taking the following precautions:stay homeÂ as much as possible, except for important medical appointments talk to your doctor, obstetrician or midwifeÂ about the possibility of telephone or videoconference appointments avoid unnecessary visitorsÂ to your home wash your handsÂ often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds use alcohol-basedÂ hand sanitizerÂ if soap and water are not available practiseÂ physical distancingÂ by keeping a distance of at least 2 metres from others avoid touchingÂ your mouth, nose and eyes avoid crowded places and peak-hours make limited trips to the store for essentials avoid travel by public transitFor more information, refer to ourÂ advice for motherson pregnancy, childbirth and caring for newborns. If you are pregnant and concerned about COVID-19, speak to your health care provider.	episode_done:True
text: I am 43 What s the chance of my survival if I get covid?	labels: Pregnant women should do the same things as everyone else to avoid COVID-19 infection, including: Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, you can use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Clean and disinfect frequently-touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash and wash your hands. Stay home when you are sick. When you must go out, practice social distancing.	episode_done:True

text: I am 43 What s the chance of my survival if I get covid?	labels: Travellers should adhere to strict hygiene measures, wash hands with soap and water regularly, and/or use alcohol-based hand sanitisers. Touching the face with unwashed hands should be avoided. Travellers should avoid contact with sick persons, in particular those with respiratory symptoms and fever. It should be emphasised that older people and those with underlying health conditions should take these precautionary measures very seriously. Travellers who develop any symptoms during or after travel should self-isolate; those developing acute respiratory symptoms within 14 days upon return should be advised to seek immediate medical advice, ideally by phone first to their national healthcare provider.	episode_done:True
text: I am 43 What s the chance of my survival if I get covid?	labels: If you are having symptoms of COVID-19, call your health care provider for a referral. If you do not have a health care provider, call 2-1-1 to be connected with a local community or hospital-connected clinic for a referral to a test site. If you are having a medical emergency, call 9-1-1 or go to the hospital. Health care providers are encouraged to order a test for any child or adult who is showing symptoms of COVID-19, even if their symptoms are mild. Find out what to do if you are sick from the CDC and what to do while youÃ¢ÂÂre waiting for test results. Pop-up Testing Sites Any Vermonter without symptoms can be tested at a pop-up testing site without a doctorÃ¢ÂÂs referral. This includes people who work in Vermont, second homeowners, and college students. Registration for testing is required. For people who do not have internet access and want to register at a pop-up site, they can call 2-1-1 for help with registration. Register for a pop-up testing site. The test is a nasopharyngeal swab, or NP swab, where a health care professional uses a swab to collect a sample from the back of the nose and throat. This test will tell you if you have a current infection. It is not a serology/antibody test, which means it will not tell you if you were infected in the past. The following groups are encouraged to get tested at pop-up sites: health care workers, first responders (EMS, fire, and law enforcement), child care providers currently serving essential workers, and anyone currently under quarantine who has had no symptoms during the first seven days of quarantine. Find more details under Ã¢ÂÂI am under a 14-day quarantine. Can I have the option to be tested and end my quarantine period?Ã¢ÂÂ on this page.	episode_done:True
text: Do I have to wear gloves and mask?	labels: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others. If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time. That is because there are not enough of these masks for health care workers. Health care workers need these masks to stay safe and to take care of sick patients. If you have extra surgical or N95 masks, please donate them to your local healthcare facility.	episode_done:True

text: Do I have to wear gloves and mask?	labels: Staying at home and using "social distancing" helps stop the virus from spreading quickly. This helps to reduce the burden on healthcare systems, as there are not enough hospital workers and beds if too many people get sick at once.Social distancing means staying farther away from other people and avoiding groups of people. Since COVID-19 mostly spreads from person-to-person interactions, staying at least 6 feet away from other people can help stop the spread. It is important to use social distancing because people can spread COVID-19 even if they feel fine. It is especially important to use social distancing to protect people who are more likely to get very sick from the disease.	episode_done:True
text: Do I have to wear gloves and mask?	labels: Children under the age of 2 years should not wear any type of masks. Because babies' airways are smaller, breathing through a mask is even harder on them and they are more likely to suffocate if they use a mask. Older infants or young toddlers are not likely to keep the mask on and will likely try to remove it. This will mean they are touching their face more and could infect themselves with the virus. It is safest to keep children at home and follow social distancing.	episode_done:True

text: How much longer will society need to socially isolate?	labels: Social distancing means maintaining a physical distance (approximately 6 feet or 2 meters) from others you do not live with. This includes when you're inside a store or outside for exercise. The COVID-19 virus spreads easily from person-to-person. It travels through the air when a sick person coughs, sneezes or talks. One way to contain the spread of COVID-19 is to stop people from sharing it. Without a vaccine or treatment, we can help contain the virus by: Staying at home to protect others if you are sick. Staying home is still the best way to lower our risk of COVID-19, but small groups of 10 or fewer people are now allowed if health and safety precautions are followed. Learn how to safely connect with friends and family. Continuing to go outside, take walks, do essential errands while maintaining a physical distance from others and practicing proper hygiene. Remember that ticks are active this time of year. Find out how to Be Tick Smart and prevent tick bites.

text: What are the side effects of hydroxychloroquine for treating COVID 19?	labels: In the lab, these drugs have been shown to prevent the growth of the virus that causes COVID-19. There are a few reports of patients with COVID-19 who received these drugs and improved. Some are reports of groups of patients, all of whom received the drug. It is not known whether it was the drug that led to the improvement or whether there were other factors involved. We do not know if the treated patientsâ condition would have improved without the drug. To know this, there would have to be a group of similar patients who did not receive the drug (control). Because chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine may possibly help very sick patients, FDA is allowing these drugs to be provided to certain hospitalized patients under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) issued March 28, 2020. Â Under the EUA, health care providers and patients are provided with information about the risks of these drugs. However, more data from clinical trials are necessary for us to determine whether chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate are safe and effective in treating or preventing COVID-19.	episode_done:True

For severe illness, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.Â  Currently there are no FDA-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of COVID-19. Researchers are studying new drugs, and drugs that are already approved for other health conditions, as possible treatments for COVID-19. The FDA is working with drug manufacturers, researchers, and other partners to accelerate the development process for COVID-19 treatments. CDC has more information for health care providers about these potential treatments. Never take a prescription medicine or drug if it is not prescribed for you by your doctor for your health condition.	episode_done:True

text: How long do you think we will have to be in a lockdown?	labels: Staying at home and using "social distancing" helps stop the virus from spreading quickly. This helps to reduce the burden on healthcare systems, as there are not enough hospital workers and beds if too many people get sick at once.Social distancing means staying farther away from other people and avoiding groups of people. Since COVID-19 mostly spreads from person-to-person interactions, staying at least 6 feet away from other people can help stop the spread. It is important to use social distancing because people can spread COVID-19 even if they feel fine. It is especially important to use social distancing to protect people who are more likely to get very sick from the disease.	episode_done:True
text: How is the corona virus being spread?	labels: COVID-19 can spread in a few different ways. It can spread from person to person if you inhale an infected person's respiratory droplets when they sneezes, coughs, or talk. It can also spead if you touch something that an infected person has touched, like a door knob, elevator button, or bathroom faucet.That's why it's important to wash your hands, avoid touching your face, and practice social distancing to avoid getting sick. That's why it's also important to self-isolate and wear a mask around other household members if you are sick to avoid infecting other people.	episode_done:True

text: How is the corona virus being spread?	labels: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others. If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time. That is because there are not enough of these masks for health care workers. Health care workers need these masks to stay safe and to take care of sick patients. If you have extra surgical or N95 masks, please donate them to your local healthcare facility.	episode_done:True
text: How is the corona virus being spread?	labels: Current thinking is that COVID-19 mostly spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets.

text: How is the corona virus being spread?	labels: COVID-19 is contagious and it is actively spreading from person to person. The CDC recommends that those who have COVID-19 are isolated either at a hospital or at home, depending on how sick they are, until they are no longer at risk of infecting others.	episode_done:True
text: How long does the virus stay on surfaces?	labels: A recent study shows that the virus can live in the air and on surfaces from several hours to several days. On plastic, it can live for up to 72 hours (3 days). On stainless steel, it can live for up to 48 hours (2 days). On cardboard, it can live up to 24 hours (1 day). On copper, it can live up to four hours. It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID-19 from these surfaces.  It is still important to regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces as well as packages and mail that come through. Remember to wash your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol based hand sanitizer (60%).	episode_done:True

text: How long does the virus stay on surfaces?	labels: Together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19 by making a conscious effort to keep a physical distance between each other. Physical (social) distancing is proven to be one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of illness during an outbreak. This means making changes in your everyday routines to minimize close contact with others, including:avoiding crowded places and non-essential gatherings avoiding common greetings, such as handshakes limiting contact with people at higher risk like older adults and those in poor health keeping a distance of at least 2 arms-length (approximately 2 metres) from others	episode_done:True

text: Can the Covid survive in the air?	labels: If you are having symptoms of COVID-19, call your health care provider for a referral. If you do not have a health care provider, call 2-1-1 to be connected with a local community or hospital-connected clinic for a referral to a test site. If you are having a medical emergency, call 9-1-1 or go to the hospital. Health care providers are encouraged to order a test for any child or adult who is showing symptoms of COVID-19, even if their symptoms are mild. Find out what to do if you are sick from the CDC and what to do while youÃ¢ÂÂre waiting for test results. Pop-up Testing Sites Any Vermonter without symptoms can be tested at a pop-up testing site without a doctorÃ¢ÂÂs referral. This includes people who work in Vermont, second homeowners, and college students. Registration for testing is required. For people who do not have internet access and want to register at a pop-up site, they can call 2-1-1 for help with registration. Register for a pop-up testing site. The test is a nasopharyngeal swab, or NP swab, where a health care professional uses a swab to collect a sample from the back of the nose and throat. This test will tell you if you have a current infection. It is not a serology/antibody test, which means it will not tell you if you were infected in the past. The following groups are encouraged to get tested at pop-up sites: health care workers, first responders (EMS, fire, and law enforcement), child care providers currently serving essential workers, and anyone currently under quarantine who has had no symptoms during the first seven days of quarantine. Find more details under Ã¢ÂÂI am under a 14-day quarantine. Can I have the option to be tested and end my quarantine period?Ã¢ÂÂ on this page.	episode_done:True
text: Can the Covid survive in the air?	labels: Fewer children seem to get infected by the coronavirus than adults, and most of those who do contract it have mild symptoms, if any.A very small number of children with the virus have shown symptoms associated with toxic shock or Kawasaki disease. This is a rare illness in children, according to the New York City Health Department, that involves inflammation of the blood vessels, including coronary arteries. Two studies conducted in recent weeks offer compelling evidence that children can transmit the virus. While neither proved it, many epidemiologists who were not involved in the research said that the evidence was strong enough to suggest that schools should be kept closed for now.

text: Does COVID 19 spread by means of gametes?	labels: In the lab, these drugs have been shown to prevent the growth of the virus that causes COVID-19. There are a few reports of patients with COVID-19 who received these drugs and improved. Some are reports of groups of patients, all of whom received the drug. It is not known whether it was the drug that led to the improvement or whether there were other factors involved. We do not know if the treated patientsâ condition would have improved without the drug. To know this, there would have to be a group of similar patients who did not receive the drug (control). Because chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine may possibly help very sick patients, FDA is allowing these drugs to be provided to certain hospitalized patients under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) issued March 28, 2020. Â Under the EUA, health care providers and patients are provided with information about the risks of these drugs. However, more data from clinical trials are necessary for us to determine whether chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate are safe and effective in treating or preventing COVID-19.	episode_done:True

text: Does COVID 19 spread by means of gametes?	labels: Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease. Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure. For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days. Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period.	episode_done:True

text: What is the estimated population that will be infected by the covid 19 virus?	labels: People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. People with mild symptoms are able to recover at home. If you experience a medical emergency such as trouble breathing, call 911 and let the operator know you may have COVID-19. For severe illness, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.Â  Currently there are no FDA-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of COVID-19. Researchers are studying new drugs, and drugs that are already approved for other health conditions, as possible treatments for COVID-19. The FDA is working with drug manufacturers, researchers, and other partners to accelerate the development process for COVID-19 treatments.

text: How many cases are in the US?	labels: COVID-19 can spread in a few different ways. It can spread from person to person if you inhale an infected person's respiratory droplets when they sneezes, coughs, or talk. It can also spead if you touch something that an infected person has touched, like a door knob, elevator button, or bathroom faucet.That's why it's important to wash your hands, avoid touching your face, and practice social distancing to avoid getting sick. That's why it's also important to self-isolate and wear a mask around other household members if you are sick to avoid infecting other people.	episode_done:True

text: Can you see friends if you stick to the social distancing guidelines?	labels: Together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19 by making a conscious effort to keep a physical distance between each other. Physical (social) distancing is proven to be one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of illness during an outbreak. This means making changes in your everyday routines to minimize close contact with others, including:avoiding crowded places and non-essential gatherings avoiding common greetings, such as handshakes limiting contact with people at higher risk like older adults and those in poor health keeping a distance of at least 2 arms-length (approximately 2 metres) from others	episode_done:True
text: Can you see friends if you stick to the social distancing guidelines?	labels: Social distancing means maintaining a physical distance (approximately 6 feet or 2 meters) from others you do not live with. This includes when you're inside a store or outside for exercise. The COVID-19 virus spreads easily from person-to-person. It travels through the air when a sick person coughs, sneezes or talks. One way to contain the spread of COVID-19 is to stop people from sharing it. Without a vaccine or treatment, we can help contain the virus by: Staying at home to protect others if you are sick. Staying home is still the best way to lower our risk of COVID-19, but small groups of 10 or fewer people are now allowed if health and safety precautions are followed. Learn how to safely connect with friends and family. Continuing to go outside, take walks, do essential errands while maintaining a physical distance from others and practicing proper hygiene. Remember that ticks are active this time of year. Find out how to Be Tick Smart and prevent tick bites. Wearing a cloth face mask or covering in public settings when a physical distance of at least 6 feet is difficult to maintain, especially at the grocery store, pharmacy, doctorÃ¢ÂÂs office, hospital or other essential business or office, and on a crowded sidewalk or bike path.

text: Can you see friends if you stick to the social distancing guidelines?	labels: âCurrently, there is no evidence that COVID-19 can spread through contact with imported goods. There have been no cases of COVID-19 in the United States associated with imported goods. Other coronaviruses do not survive well on surfaces. So, experts think the risk of spread from products or packages shipped over days or weeks is extremely low. Coronaviruses spread most often by small droplets of mucus from the nose and throat.	episode_done:True
text: Can you see friends if you stick to the social distancing guidelines?	labels: If you don't have access to hand sanitizer, soap and water are always the best option.Make sure any hand santizer you have has at least 60% alcohol, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Any hand sanitizer that has less than 60% alcohol will not be effective at killing the virus.	episode_done:True

text: When having covid 19 What are the next possible symptoms for a 4 years old child?	labels: Fewer children seem to get infected by the coronavirus than adults, and most of those who do contract it have mild symptoms, if any.A very small number of children with the virus have shown symptoms associated with toxic shock or Kawasaki disease. This is a rare illness in children, according to the New York City Health Department, that involves inflammation of the blood vessels, including coronary arteries. Two studies conducted in recent weeks offer compelling evidence that children can transmit the virus. While neither proved it, many epidemiologists who were not involved in the research said that the evidence was strong enough to suggest that schools should be kept closed for now.

text: how can I help to prevent spread of corona virus?	labels: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others. If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time.

text: What are the symptoms in children?	labels: Children under the age of 2 years should not wear any type of masks. Because babies' airways are smaller, breathing through a mask is even harder on them and they are more likely to suffocate if they use a mask. Older infants or young toddlers are not likely to keep the mask on and will likely try to remove it. This will mean they are touching their face more and could infect themselves with the virus.

text: How does COVID 19 spread?	labels: In the lab, these drugs have been shown to prevent the growth of the virus that causes COVID-19. There are a few reports of patients with COVID-19 who received these drugs and improved. Some are reports of groups of patients, all of whom received the drug. It is not known whether it was the drug that led to the improvement or whether there were other factors involved. We do not know if the treated patientsâ condition would have improved without the drug. To know this, there would have to be a group of similar patients who did not receive the drug (control). Because chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine may possibly help very sick patients, FDA is allowing these drugs to be provided to certain hospitalized patients under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) issued March 28, 2020. Â Under the EUA, health care providers and patients are provided with information about the risks of these drugs. However, more data from clinical trials are necessary for us to determine whether chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate are safe and effective in treating or preventing COVID-19.	episode_done:True

text: how is covid 19 spread?	labels: Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease. Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure. For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days. Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period.	episode_done:True

text: What are the symptoms?	labels: Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. There are different types of coronaviruses.Some types of coronavirus are more common in people and some versions are more common in animals.

text: Can I get the virus from a stray cat?	labels: Preliminary findings from limited laboratory experimental studies indicate that, of species tested thus far, cats are the species most susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2. Some cats in these studies developed signs of clinical disease. Ferrets were also found to be susceptible to infection, but appeared less likely to develop disease. In the laboratory setting cats and ferrets were also able to transmit SARS-CoV-2 to other cats and ferrets, respectively. Golden Syrian hamsters were also able to be experimentally infected and were able to spread the infection to other hamsters. Dogs appeared to be susceptible to infection, but less so than cats or ferrets. Other preliminary laboratory findings indicate that poultry and pigs are not susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2.It is important to understand that experimentally induced infection does not mirror naturally induced infection. In other words, just because an animal can be experimentally infected via inoculation with high concentrations of purified tissue-cultured virus does not mean that it will be easily be infected with that same virus under natural conditions. The number of animals involved in these studies was also very small and conclusions were drawn based on data that, in some cases, were collected from as few as two animals. There is no evidence to suggest that animals, including pets, that may be incidentally infected by humans are playing a role in the spread of COVID-19. Human outbreaks are driven by person-to-person transmission.	episode_done:True
text: Can I get the virus from a stray cat?	labels: Right now, COVID-19 mostly spreads from person to person. But experts agree that the virus likely came from bats and may have passed through another type of animal in China before spreading to people. If you are going to travel, check the latest health notices for up-to-date advice before you leave. Avoid contact with animals, including wild meat and live animal markets.Animal importers, rescues, and adoptive families should limit or postpone importing animals from affected areas. If animals are imported from an affected area, monitor them closely for illness. Call a veterinarian if they get sick and call before bringing them to the office so that they can prepare.	episode_done:True
text: Can I get the virus from a stray cat?	labels: If you are having symptoms of COVID-19, call your health care provider for a referral. If you do not have a health care provider, call 2-1-1 to be connected with a local community or hospital-connected clinic for a referral to a test site. If you are having a medical emergency, call 9-1-1 or go to the hospital. Health care providers are encouraged to order a test for any child or adult who is showing symptoms of COVID-19, even if their symptoms are mild. Find out what to do if you are sick from the CDC and what to do while youÃ¢ÂÂre waiting for test results. Pop-up Testing Sites Any Vermonter without symptoms can be tested at a pop-up testing site without a doctorÃ¢ÂÂs referral. This includes people who work in Vermont, second homeowners, and college students. Registration for testing is required. For people who do not have internet access and want to register at a pop-up site, they can call 2-1-1 for help with registration. Register for a pop-up testing site. The test is a nasopharyngeal swab, or NP swab, where a health care professional uses a swab to collect a sample from the back of the nose and throat. This test will tell you if you have a current infection. It is not a serology/antibody test, which means it will not tell you if you were infected in the past. The following groups are encouraged to get tested at pop-up sites: health care workers, first responders (EMS, fire, and law enforcement), child care providers currently serving essential workers, and anyone currently under quarantine who has had no symptoms during the first seven days of quarantine. Find more details under Ã¢ÂÂI am under a 14-day quarantine. Can I have the option to be tested and end my quarantine period?Ã¢ÂÂ on this page.	episode_done:True
text: Can I get the virus from a stray cat?	labels: Right now, we don't know of any clear cases of the virus passing from people to their pets. There was a tiger in a zoo in New York City that seems to have gotten COVID-19 from its caretakers. To be safe, wash your hands before and after touching animals. Until we know more, if you have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and have a pet or other animal, you should:1. Avoid close contact with them. Do not snuggle or kiss them, let them lick you, sit on your lap, or sleep in your bed. 2. Avoid coughing and sneezing on your animals. Cover your coughs and sneezes. 3. Have another member of your household care for your animals, if you can. 4. If it's not possible to have someone else care for your animal, always wash your hands before touching or feeding them. 5. Limit your animal's contact with other people and animals. Tthis may mean keeping them indoors.We might learn more about human to animal spread in the future.

text: How long does the virus survive on a surface like a doorknob?	labels: A recent study shows that the virus can live in the air and on surfaces from several hours to several days. On plastic, it can live for up to 72 hours (3 days). On stainless steel, it can live for up to 48 hours (2 days). On cardboard, it can live up to 24 hours (1 day). On copper, it can live up to four hours. It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID-19 from these surfaces.  It is still important to regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces as well as packages and mail that come through. Remember to wash your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol based hand sanitizer (60%).	episode_done:True
text: How long does the virus survive on a surface like a doorknob?	labels: Current thinking is that COVID-19 mostly spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets.

Your doctor will look for signs that:-You are fever-free without taking fever-reducing medication -You no longer show symptoms -Sometimes, your doctor might recommend testing respiratory samples to decide if you can be released from isolationOnce you have been released from isolation, then you are no longer considered to be likely to infect other people.	episode_done:True
text: How long does the virus survive on a surface like a doorknob?	labels: COVID-19 can spread in a few different ways.

text: How long does the virus survive on a surface like a doorknob?	labels: Together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19 by making a conscious effort to keep a physical distance between each other. Physical (social) distancing is proven to be one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of illness during an outbreak. This means making changes in your everyday routines to minimize close contact with others, including:avoiding crowded places and non-essential gatherings avoiding common greetings, such as handshakes limiting contact with people at higher risk like older adults and those in poor health keeping a distance of at least 2 arms-length (approximately 2 metres) from others	episode_done:True
text: How long does it stays on fabric?	labels: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others.

This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time.

Never take a prescription medicine or drug if it is not prescribed for you by your doctor for your health condition.	episode_done:True
text: does wearing mask protect me from covid 19?	labels: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others. If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time. That is because there are not enough of these masks for health care workers. Health care workers need these masks to stay safe and to take care of sick patients.

text: does wearing mask protect me from covid 19?	labels: COVID-19 can spread in a few different ways. It can spread from person to person if you inhale an infected person's respiratory droplets when they sneezes, coughs, or talk. It can also spead if you touch something that an infected person has touched, like a door knob, elevator button, or bathroom faucet.That's why it's important to wash your hands, avoid touching your face, and practice social distancing to avoid getting sick. That's why it's also important to self-isolate and wear a mask around other household members if you are sick to avoid infecting other people.	episode_done:True
text: Should I stay quarantined?	labels: Staying at home and using "social distancing" helps stop the virus from spreading quickly. This helps to reduce the burden on healthcare systems, as there are not enough hospital workers and beds if too many people get sick at once.Social distancing means staying farther away from other people and avoiding groups of people. Since COVID-19 mostly spreads from person-to-person interactions, staying at least 6 feet away from other people can help stop the spread. It is important to use social distancing because people can spread COVID-19 even if they feel fine. It is especially important to use social distancing to protect people who are more likely to get very sick from the disease.	episode_done:True

text: Should I stay quarantined?	labels: Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease. Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure. For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days. Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period.	episode_done:True

That's why it's also important to self-isolate and wear a mask around other household members if you are sick to avoid infecting other people.	episode_done:True
text: How long does it last once infected?	labels: Together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19 by making a conscious effort to keep a physical distance between each other. Physical (social) distancing is proven to be one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of illness during an outbreak. This means making changes in your everyday routines to minimize close contact with others, including:avoiding crowded places and non-essential gatherings avoiding common greetings, such as handshakes limiting contact with people at higher risk like older adults and those in poor health keeping a distance of at least 2 arms-length (approximately 2 metres) from others	episode_done:True

text: should I wear a mask?	labels: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others. If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time.

text: How many days can you be contagious without showing symptoms?	labels: There is currently no evidence that COVID-19 is being spread through the mail. Coronaviruses do not survive well on surfaces. So, experts think the risk of spread from products or packages shipped over days or weeks is extremely low.	episode_done:True
text: How many young adults are being hospitalised Like in percentage?	labels: Right now, most experts think that children can get the virus at the same rates as adults. But children usually don't get as sick as adults. If a child gets COVID-19, their symptoms are going to be similar to the symptoms adults get. These include fever, runny nose, and cough. Vomiting and diarrhea are also possible.	episode_done:True

text: How many young adults are being hospitalised Like in percentage?	labels: A recent study shows that the virus can live in the air and on surfaces from several hours to several days. On plastic, it can live for up to 72 hours (3 days). On stainless steel, it can live for up to 48 hours (2 days). On cardboard, it can live up to 24 hours (1 day). On copper, it can live up to four hours. It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID-19 from these surfaces.  It is still important to regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces as well as packages and mail that come through. Remember to wash your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol based hand sanitizer (60%).	episode_done:True

text: How long does the virus stay in paper money and coins?	labels: Staying at home and using "social distancing" helps stop the virus from spreading quickly. This helps to reduce the burden on healthcare systems, as there are not enough hospital workers and beds if too many people get sick at once.Social distancing means staying farther away from other people and avoiding groups of people. Since COVID-19 mostly spreads from person-to-person interactions, staying at least 6 feet away from other people can help stop the spread. It is important to use social distancing because people can spread COVID-19 even if they feel fine. It is especially important to use social distancing to protect people who are more likely to get very sick from the disease.	episode_done:True
text: How long does the virus stay in paper money and coins?	labels: How long you should be isolated for varies on a case-by-case basis. If you have been sick with COVID-19 and have been in isolation, you should talk to your healthcare provider to decide when you can be released from isolation. Your doctor will look for signs that:-You are fever-free without taking fever-reducing medication -You no longer show symptoms -Sometimes, your doctor might recommend testing respiratory samples to decide if you can be released from isolationOnce you have been released from isolation, then you are no longer considered to be likely to infect other people.	episode_done:True
text: How long does the virus stay in paper money and coins?	labels: COVID-19 can spread in a few different ways.

It can also spead if you touch something that an infected person has touched, like a door knob, elevator button, or bathroom faucet.That's why it's important to wash your hands, avoid touching your face, and practice social distancing to avoid getting sick. That's why it's also important to self-isolate and wear a mask around other household members if you are sick to avoid infecting other people.	episode_done:True
text: How long does the virus stay in paper money and coins?	labels: Together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19 by making a conscious effort to keep a physical distance between each other. Physical (social) distancing is proven to be one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of illness during an outbreak. This means making changes in your everyday routines to minimize close contact with others, including:avoiding crowded places and non-essential gatherings avoiding common greetings, such as handshakes limiting contact with people at higher risk like older adults and those in poor health keeping a distance of at least 2 arms-length (approximately 2 metres) from others	episode_done:True

If you experience a medical emergency such as trouble breathing, call 911 and let the operator know you may have COVID-19. For severe illness, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.Â  Currently there are no FDA-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of COVID-19. Researchers are studying new drugs, and drugs that are already approved for other health conditions, as possible treatments for COVID-19. The FDA is working with drug manufacturers, researchers, and other partners to accelerate the development process for COVID-19 treatments.

text: How fast does it spread?	labels: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others. If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time. That is because there are not enough of these masks for health care workers. Health care workers need these masks to stay safe and to take care of sick patients. If you have extra surgical or N95 masks, please donate them to your local healthcare facility.	episode_done:True

We are still learning how COVID-19 spreads and if a deceased body can transmit the virus. One could get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it, and then touching their face (like their mouth, nose, or eyes). Try to avoid kissing washing, and shrouding the body. If washing and shrouding the body are important in your culture or religion, work with your community cultural and religious leaders as well as funeral home staff to try to reduce exposure as much as possible. People who conduct these activities should wear disposable gloves. If fluid splashing is expected, more personal protective equipment may be needed, such as disposable gowns, goggles, and face masks.	episode_done:True
text: How to differentiate between coronavirus and simple flu?	labels: You need to self-isolate if you have been confirmed to have COVID-19. Isolation is a health care term that means keeping infected people away from those who are not infected. If you have been asked to self-isolate, you should:-Stay at home except to get medical care -Stay away from other people in your home as much as you can -Wear a face mask if you need to be around other people (for example, in a doctor's office) -Cover your coughs and sneezes -Wash your hands frequently -Continue to monitor your symptoms until your doctor says you don't need to be in isolation any moreQuarantine means staying away from other people because you might have been exposed to the virus. For COVID-19, people should quarantine for at least 14 days, or 2 weeks from the time they might have had contact with someone with COVID-19. That's because most people who get COVID-19 would have symptoms within 14 days. Scientists think that people are not likely to spread COVID-19 to others if they do not get sick after 14 days.	episode_done:True
text: How to differentiate between coronavirus and simple flu?	labels: The difference between self-monitoring and self-isolation is based on whether you have been diagnosed with COVID-19 or not. If you may have been exposed to COVID-19 but don't have symptoms, you should self-monitor. If you have been diagnosed with COVID-19, you should self-isolate.You need to self-monitor if you have no symptoms but may have been exposed to COVID-19 in the last 14 days or are in close contact with older adults, people who are medically vulnerable or have been asked to do so by your Public Health Authority. Self-monitoring means you should:-Monitor yourself for 14 days for symptoms like fever, cough, and trouble breathing -Stay at home -Avoid crowded places -Stay at least 6 feet away from others as much as you can -Wash your hands frequentlyYou need to self-isolate if you have been confirmed to have COVID-19.

text: How to differentiate between coronavirus and simple flu?	labels: COVID-19 can spread in a few different ways. It can spread from person to person if you inhale an infected person's respiratory droplets when they sneezes, coughs, or talk. It can also spead if you touch something that an infected person has touched, like a door knob, elevator button, or bathroom faucet.That's why it's important to wash your hands, avoid touching your face, and practice social distancing to avoid getting sick. That's why it's also important to self-isolate and wear a mask around other household members if you are sick to avoid infecting other people.	episode_done:True
text: Does covid 19 spread in warm weather?	labels: Scientists are still looking into this. Some studies suggest that warmer places account for a smaller share of global cases and have had slower infection rates. But none of these findings have been peer-reviewed yet. And even if a certain temperature and humidity diminished the spread, that wouldnât preclude the virusâ return when the weather cools again.	episode_done:True

text: Does covid 19 spread in warm weather?	labels: Current thinking is that COVID-19 mostly spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets. But some studies show that the virus can last on surfaces, so it is possible that someone could get the virus by touching a surface that has the virus on it and then touching their mouth, nose, or eyes.	episode_done:True
text: Does covid 19 spread in warm weather?	labels: In the lab, these drugs have been shown to prevent the growth of the virus that causes COVID-19. There are a few reports of patients with COVID-19 who received these drugs and improved. Some are reports of groups of patients, all of whom received the drug. It is not known whether it was the drug that led to the improvement or whether there were other factors involved. We do not know if the treated patientsâ condition would have improved without the drug. To know this, there would have to be a group of similar patients who did not receive the drug (control). Because chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine may possibly help very sick patients, FDA is allowing these drugs to be provided to certain hospitalized patients under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) issued March 28, 2020. Â Under the EUA, health care providers and patients are provided with information about the risks of these drugs. However, more data from clinical trials are necessary for us to determine whether chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate are safe and effective in treating or preventing COVID-19.	episode_done:True
text: Does covid 19 spread in warm weather?	labels: COVID-19 is contagious and it is actively spreading from person to person. The CDC recommends that those who have COVID-19 are isolated either at a hospital or at home, depending on how sick they are, until they are no longer at risk of infecting others.	episode_done:True
text: What are the symptoms?	labels: Those who are infected with COVID-19 may have little to no symptoms. You may not know you have symptoms of COVID-19 because they are similar to a cold or flu. Symptoms haveincluded:cough fever difficulty breathing pneumonia in both lungsIn severe cases, infection can leadto death.Symptoms may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to COVID-19. This is the longest known incubation period for this disease.Recent evidence indicates that the virus can be transmitted to othersfrom someone who is infected but not showing symptoms. This includes peoplewho:have not yet developed symptoms (pre-symptomatic) never develop symptoms (asymptomatic)While experts know that these kinds of transmissions are happening amongthose in close contact or in close physical settings, it is not known to whatextent. This means it is extremely important to follow the proven preventative measures.Think you might have COVID-19? Take a self-assessment	episode_done:True
text: What are the symptoms?	labels: Children and adults have the same COVID-19 symptoms, although children might not get as sick as adults. Children might get a fever, runny nose, or cough.

COVID-19 causes some symptoms that are like getting a cold or flu. But some people get worse symptoms and need more care. COVID-19 is caused by a new type of virus that our body has not seen before. Since our body has not seen it before, our immune system has to learn how to fight off this new virus.	episode_done:True
text: Do I have to wear a mask all the time if I am not infected?	labels: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others. If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time. That is because there are not enough of these masks for health care workers. Health care workers need these masks to stay safe and to take care of sick patients. If you have extra surgical or N95 masks, please donate them to your local healthcare facility.	episode_done:True
text: Do I have to wear a mask all the time if I am not infected?	labels: The risk of COVID-19 spreading from products or packaging shipped over a period of days or weeks is likely to be low. Currently, there is no evidence that COVID-19 has been spread from imported goods.	episode_done:True
text: Do I have to wear a mask all the time if I am not infected?	labels: It is a challenging time with schools, daycares and unversities being closed.

If your child attends a  college or university , encourage them to learn about the schoolâs plan for a COVID-19 outbreak.	episode_done:True
text: Do I have to wear a mask all the time if I am not infected?	labels: Social distancing helps to reduce the chance of infecting people who are more likely to get severe disease. It helps to stop the virus from spreading quickly. This also helps to prevent there being too many sick people for hospitals to handle.	episode_done:True
text: Do I have to wear a mask all the time if I am not infected?	labels: Staying at home and using "social distancing" helps stop the virus from spreading quickly. This helps to reduce the burden on healthcare systems, as there are not enough hospital workers and beds if too many people get sick at once.Social distancing means staying farther away from other people and avoiding groups of people. Since COVID-19 mostly spreads from person-to-person interactions, staying at least 6 feet away from other people can help stop the spread. It is important to use social distancing because people can spread COVID-19 even if they feel fine. It is especially important to use social distancing to protect people who are more likely to get very sick from the disease.	episode_done:True

text: Would using heated vapor humidifier help with sanitizing the sinuses of the covid 19?	labels: Together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19 by making a conscious effort to keep a physical distance between each other. Physical (social) distancing is proven to be one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of illness during an outbreak. This means making changes in your everyday routines to minimize close contact with others, including:avoiding crowded places and non-essential gatherings avoiding common greetings, such as handshakes limiting contact with people at higher risk like older adults and those in poor health keeping a distance of at least 2 arms-length (approximately 2 metres) from others	episode_done:True
text: Would using heated vapor humidifier help with sanitizing the sinuses of the covid 19?	labels: People can fight stigma by providing social support in situations where you notice this is occurring. Stigma affects the emotional or  mental health  of stigmatized groups and the communities they live in. Stopping stigma is important to making communities and community members resilient. See  resources on mental health and coping during COVID-19 . Everyone can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by  knowing the facts  and sharing them with others in your community.	episode_done:True

text: Should I star home and even avoid going to the supermarket and drugstore?	labels: Staying at home and using "social distancing" helps stop the virus from spreading quickly. This helps to reduce the burden on healthcare systems, as there are not enough hospital workers and beds if too many people get sick at once.Social distancing means staying farther away from other people and avoiding groups of people. Since COVID-19 mostly spreads from person-to-person interactions, staying at least 6 feet away from other people can help stop the spread. It is important to use social distancing because people can spread COVID-19 even if they feel fine. It is especially important to use social distancing to protect people who are more likely to get very sick from the disease.	episode_done:True

Health care providers are encouraged to order a test for any child or adult who is showing symptoms of COVID-19, even if their symptoms are mild.	episode_done:True
text: Should I star home and even avoid going to the supermarket and drugstore?	labels: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others. If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time. That is because there are not enough of these masks for health care workers. Health care workers need these masks to stay safe and to take care of sick patients. If you have extra surgical or N95 masks, please donate them to your local healthcare facility.	episode_done:True
text: Should I star home and even avoid going to the supermarket and drugstore?	labels: Social distancing means maintaining a physical distance (approximately 6 feet or 2 meters) from others you do not live with. This includes when you're inside a store or outside for exercise. The COVID-19 virus spreads easily from person-to-person. It travels through the air when a sick person coughs, sneezes or talks. One way to contain the spread of COVID-19 is to stop people from sharing it. Without a vaccine or treatment, we can help contain the virus by: Staying at home to protect others if you are sick. Staying home is still the best way to lower our risk of COVID-19, but small groups of 10 or fewer people are now allowed if health and safety precautions are followed. Learn how to safely connect with friends and family. Continuing to go outside, take walks, do essential errands while maintaining a physical distance from others and practicing proper hygiene. Remember that ticks are active this time of year. Find out how to Be Tick Smart and prevent tick bites. Wearing a cloth face mask or covering in public settings when a physical distance of at least 6 feet is difficult to maintain, especially at the grocery store, pharmacy, doctorÃ¢ÂÂs office, hospital or other essential business or office, and on a crowded sidewalk or bike path.

This means making changes in your everyday routines to minimize close contact with others, including:avoiding crowded places and non-essential gatherings avoiding common greetings, such as handshakes limiting contact with people at higher risk like older adults and those in poor health keeping a distance of at least 2 arms-length (approximately 2 metres) from others	episode_done:True
text: Will social distancing slow the spread of covid 19?	labels: COVID-19 can spread in a few different ways. It can spread from person to person if you inhale an infected person's respiratory droplets when they sneezes, coughs, or talk. It can also spead if you touch something that an infected person has touched, like a door knob, elevator button, or bathroom faucet.That's why it's important to wash your hands, avoid touching your face, and practice social distancing to avoid getting sick. That's why it's also important to self-isolate and wear a mask around other household members if you are sick to avoid infecting other people.	episode_done:True
text: Will social distancing slow the spread of covid 19?	labels: Current thinking is that COVID-19 mostly spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets. But some studies show that the virus can last on surfaces, so it is possible that someone could get the virus by touching a surface that has the virus on it and then touching their mouth, nose, or eyes.	episode_done:True
text: Will social distancing slow the spread of covid 19?	labels: COVID-19 is contagious and it is actively spreading from person to person. The CDC recommends that those who have COVID-19 are isolated either at a hospital or at home, depending on how sick they are, until they are no longer at risk of infecting others.	episode_done:True
text: Will social distancing slow the spread of covid 19?	labels: Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease. Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure. For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days. Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period.	episode_done:True

text: What is corona virus?	labels: MERS-CoV is one type of coronavirus. It is different type from the type of coronavirus that causes COVID-19. MERS-CoV stands for "Middle East Respiratory Syndrome- associated Coronavirus."The first cases of MERS-CoV were seen in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. MERS-CoV symptoms are fever, cough, and shortness of breath. People with this disease usually do not get sick from one another unless they are in very close contact.	episode_done:True
text: What is corona virus?	labels: SARS-CoV stands for "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-associated CoronaVirus." It is a virus that can cause serious problems with breathing and the lungs. It is different from the virus that has caused the COVID-19 pandemic. The SARS-CoV virus was first found in Asia in 2003 and last known human case was in China in 2004. SARS-CoV spreads through close person to person contact and caused flu like symptoms.	episode_done:True

text: How long can the virus stay in the air?	labels: According to the WHO, these droplets are heavy enough that they cannot travel more than around 3 feet (1 meter). However, other research has found they can travel 23â27 feet (7â8 meters).	episode_done:True
text: How long can the virus stay in the air?	labels: Staying at home and using "social distancing" helps stop the virus from spreading quickly. This helps to reduce the burden on healthcare systems, as there are not enough hospital workers and beds if too many people get sick at once.Social distancing means staying farther away from other people and avoiding groups of people. Since COVID-19 mostly spreads from person-to-person interactions, staying at least 6 feet away from other people can help stop the spread. It is important to use social distancing because people can spread COVID-19 even if they feel fine. It is especially important to use social distancing to protect people who are more likely to get very sick from the disease.	episode_done:True

text: How long can the virus stay in the air?	labels: A recent study shows that the virus can live in the air and on surfaces from several hours to several days. On plastic, it can live for up to 72 hours (3 days). On stainless steel, it can live for up to 48 hours (2 days). On cardboard, it can live up to 24 hours (1 day). On copper, it can live up to four hours. It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID-19 from these surfaces.  It is still important to regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces as well as packages and mail that come through. Remember to wash your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol based hand sanitizer (60%).	episode_done:True

text: Does a mask actually help if I m not sick?	labels: Together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19 by making a conscious effort to keep a physical distance between each other. Physical (social) distancing is proven to be one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of illness during an outbreak. This means making changes in your everyday routines to minimize close contact with others, including:avoiding crowded places and non-essential gatherings avoiding common greetings, such as handshakes limiting contact with people at higher risk like older adults and those in poor health keeping a distance of at least 2 arms-length (approximately 2 metres) from others	episode_done:True
text: Does a mask actually help if I m not sick?	labels: Fewer children seem to get infected by the coronavirus than adults, and most of those who do contract it have mild symptoms, if any.A very small number of children with the virus have shown symptoms associated with toxic shock or Kawasaki disease. This is a rare illness in children, according to the New York City Health Department, that involves inflammation of the blood vessels, including coronary arteries. Two studies conducted in recent weeks offer compelling evidence that children can transmit the virus. While neither proved it, many epidemiologists who were not involved in the research said that the evidence was strong enough to suggest that schools should be kept closed for now.

This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time. That is because there are not enough of these masks for health care workers. Health care workers need these masks to stay safe and to take care of sick patients. If you have extra surgical or N95 masks, please donate them to your local healthcare facility.	episode_done:True

text: How long will the pandemic last?	labels: How long you should be isolated for varies on a case-by-case basis. If you have been sick with COVID-19 and have been in isolation, you should talk to your healthcare provider to decide when you can be released from isolation. Your doctor will look for signs that:-You are fever-free without taking fever-reducing medication -You no longer show symptoms -Sometimes, your doctor might recommend testing respiratory samples to decide if you can be released from isolationOnce you have been released from isolation, then you are no longer considered to be likely to infect other people.	episode_done:True
text: How long will the pandemic last?	labels: A recent study shows that the virus can live in the air and on surfaces from several hours to several days. On plastic, it can live for up to 72 hours (3 days). On stainless steel, it can live for up to 48 hours (2 days). On cardboard, it can live up to 24 hours (1 day). On copper, it can live up to four hours. It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID-19 from these surfaces.  It is still important to regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces as well as packages and mail that come through. Remember to wash your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol based hand sanitizer (60%).	episode_done:True
text: How long will the pandemic last?	labels: Quarantine means staying away from other people because you might have been exposed to the virus. For COVID-19, people should quarantine for at least 14 days, or 2 weeks from the time they might have had contact with someone with COVID-19. That's because most people who get COVID-19 would have symptoms within 14 days. Scientists think that people are not likely to spread COVID-19 to others if they do not get sick after 14 days. Remember, every time you could have been exposed to the virus means you should restart your 14 day clock for quarantine.	episode_done:True

text: Can my dog get COVID 19 and transmit it to other people?	labels: Preliminary findings from limited laboratory experimental studies indicate that, of species tested thus far, cats are the species most susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2. Some cats in these studies developed signs of clinical disease. Ferrets were also found to be susceptible to infection, but appeared less likely to develop disease. In the laboratory setting cats and ferrets were also able to transmit SARS-CoV-2 to other cats and ferrets, respectively. Golden Syrian hamsters were also able to be experimentally infected and were able to spread the infection to other hamsters. Dogs appeared to be susceptible to infection, but less so than cats or ferrets. Other preliminary laboratory findings indicate that poultry and pigs are not susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2.It is important to understand that experimentally induced infection does not mirror naturally induced infection. In other words, just because an animal can be experimentally infected via inoculation with high concentrations of purified tissue-cultured virus does not mean that it will be easily be infected with that same virus under natural conditions. The number of animals involved in these studies was also very small and conclusions were drawn based on data that, in some cases, were collected from as few as two animals. There is no evidence to suggest that animals, including pets, that may be incidentally infected by humans are playing a role in the spread of COVID-19. Human outbreaks are driven by person-to-person transmission.	episode_done:True
text: Can my dog get COVID 19 and transmit it to other people?	labels: Right now, we don't know of any clear cases of the virus passing from people to their pets. There was a tiger in a zoo in New York City that seems to have gotten COVID-19 from its caretakers. To be safe, wash your hands before and after touching animals. Until we know more, if you have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and have a pet or other animal, you should:1. Avoid close contact with them. Do not snuggle or kiss them, let them lick you, sit on your lap, or sleep in your bed. 2. Avoid coughing and sneezing on your animals. Cover your coughs and sneezes. 3. Have another member of your household care for your animals, if you can. 4. If it's not possible to have someone else care for your animal, always wash your hands before touching or feeding them. 5. Limit your animal's contact with other people and animals. Tthis may mean keeping them indoors.We might learn more about human to animal spread in the future. Talk to your pet's doctor if you are worried about your pet's health.	episode_done:True
text: Can my dog get COVID 19 and transmit it to other people?	labels: Right now, COVID-19 mostly spreads from person to person. But experts agree that the virus likely came from bats and may have passed through another type of animal in China before spreading to people. If you are going to travel, check the latest health notices for up-to-date advice before you leave. Avoid contact with animals, including wild meat and live animal markets.Animal importers, rescues, and adoptive families should limit or postpone importing animals from affected areas. If animals are imported from an affected area, monitor them closely for illness. Call a veterinarian if they get sick and call before bringing them to the office so that they can prepare.	episode_done:True
text: Can my dog get COVID 19 and transmit it to other people?	labels: If you are having symptoms of COVID-19, call your health care provider for a referral. If you do not have a health care provider, call 2-1-1 to be connected with a local community or hospital-connected clinic for a referral to a test site. If you are having a medical emergency, call 9-1-1 or go to the hospital. Health care providers are encouraged to order a test for any child or adult who is showing symptoms of COVID-19, even if their symptoms are mild. Find out what to do if you are sick from the CDC and what to do while youÃ¢ÂÂre waiting for test results. Pop-up Testing Sites Any Vermonter without symptoms can be tested at a pop-up testing site without a doctorÃ¢ÂÂs referral. This includes people who work in Vermont, second homeowners, and college students. Registration for testing is required. For people who do not have internet access and want to register at a pop-up site, they can call 2-1-1 for help with registration. Register for a pop-up testing site. The test is a nasopharyngeal swab, or NP swab, where a health care professional uses a swab to collect a sample from the back of the nose and throat. This test will tell you if you have a current infection. It is not a serology/antibody test, which means it will not tell you if you were infected in the past. The following groups are encouraged to get tested at pop-up sites: health care workers, first responders (EMS, fire, and law enforcement), child care providers currently serving essential workers, and anyone currently under quarantine who has had no symptoms during the first seven days of quarantine. Find more details under Ã¢ÂÂI am under a 14-day quarantine. Can I have the option to be tested and end my quarantine period?Ã¢ÂÂ on this page.	episode_done:True
text: Can my dog get COVID 19 and transmit it to other people?	labels: People can fight stigma by providing social support in situations where you notice this is occurring. Stigma affects the emotional or  mental health  of stigmatized groups and the communities they live in. Stopping stigma is important to making communities and community members resilient.

text: what are the symptoms of covid 19?	labels: People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. People with mild symptoms are able to recover at home. If you experience a medical emergency such as trouble breathing, call 911 and let the operator know you may have COVID-19. For severe illness, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.Â  Currently there are no FDA-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of COVID-19. Researchers are studying new drugs, and drugs that are already approved for other health conditions, as possible treatments for COVID-19. The FDA is working with drug manufacturers, researchers, and other partners to accelerate the development process for COVID-19 treatments. CDC has more information for health care providers about these potential treatments.

text: How long do I have stay in isolation?	labels: Staying at home and using "social distancing" helps stop the virus from spreading quickly. This helps to reduce the burden on healthcare systems, as there are not enough hospital workers and beds if too many people get sick at once.Social distancing means staying farther away from other people and avoiding groups of people. Since COVID-19 mostly spreads from person-to-person interactions, staying at least 6 feet away from other people can help stop the spread. It is important to use social distancing because people can spread COVID-19 even if they feel fine. It is especially important to use social distancing to protect people who are more likely to get very sick from the disease.	episode_done:True

text: How long do I have stay in isolation?	labels: You need to self-isolate if you have been confirmed to have COVID-19. Isolation is a health care term that means keeping infected people away from those who are not infected. If you have been asked to self-isolate, you should:-Stay at home except to get medical care -Stay away from other people in your home as much as you can -Wear a face mask if you need to be around other people (for example, in a doctor's office) -Cover your coughs and sneezes -Wash your hands frequently -Continue to monitor your symptoms until your doctor says you don't need to be in isolation any moreQuarantine means staying away from other people because you might have been exposed to the virus. For COVID-19, people should quarantine for at least 14 days, or 2 weeks from the time they might have had contact with someone with COVID-19. That's because most people who get COVID-19 would have symptoms within 14 days. Scientists think that people are not likely to spread COVID-19 to others if they do not get sick after 14 days.	episode_done:True
text: How long do I have stay in isolation?	labels: It is a challenging time with schools, daycares and unversities being closed.

text: How long does COVID 19 live on glass surfaces?	labels: In the lab, these drugs have been shown to prevent the growth of the virus that causes COVID-19. There are a few reports of patients with COVID-19 who received these drugs and improved. Some are reports of groups of patients, all of whom received the drug. It is not known whether it was the drug that led to the improvement or whether there were other factors involved. We do not know if the treated patientsâ condition would have improved without the drug. To know this, there would have to be a group of similar patients who did not receive the drug (control). Because chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine may possibly help very sick patients, FDA is allowing these drugs to be provided to certain hospitalized patients under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) issued March 28, 2020. Â Under the EUA, health care providers and patients are provided with information about the risks of these drugs. However, more data from clinical trials are necessary for us to determine whether chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate are safe and effective in treating or preventing COVID-19.	episode_done:True
text: How long does COVID 19 live on glass surfaces?	labels: Together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19 by making a conscious effort to keep a physical distance between each other. Physical (social) distancing is proven to be one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of illness during an outbreak. This means making changes in your everyday routines to minimize close contact with others, including:avoiding crowded places and non-essential gatherings avoiding common greetings, such as handshakes limiting contact with people at higher risk like older adults and those in poor health keeping a distance of at least 2 arms-length (approximately 2 metres) from others	episode_done:True

But some people get worse symptoms and need more care. COVID-19 is caused by a new type of virus that our body has not seen before. Since our body has not seen it before, our immune system has to learn how to fight off this new virus.	episode_done:True
text: Symptoms?	labels: Those who are infected with COVID-19 may have little to no symptoms. You may not know you have symptoms of COVID-19 because they are similar to a cold or flu. Symptoms haveincluded:cough fever difficulty breathing pneumonia in both lungsIn severe cases, infection can leadto death.Symptoms may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to COVID-19. This is the longest known incubation period for this disease.Recent evidence indicates that the virus can be transmitted to othersfrom someone who is infected but not showing symptoms. This includes peoplewho:have not yet developed symptoms (pre-symptomatic) never develop symptoms (asymptomatic)While experts know that these kinds of transmissions are happening amongthose in close contact or in close physical settings, it is not known to whatextent. This means it is extremely important to follow the proven preventative measures.Think you might have COVID-19? Take a self-assessment	episode_done:True
text: Symptoms?	labels: Children and adults have the same COVID-19 symptoms, although children might not get as sick as adults. Children might get a fever, runny nose, or cough. Some children have had vomiting or diarrhea. We are still learning about how COVID-19 affects children.	episode_done:True

text: Symptoms?	labels: The time between exposure to the COVID-19 virus and onset of symptoms is called the âincubation period.â The incubation period for COVID-19 is typically 2 to 14 days, although in some cases it may be longer.	episode_done:True
text: how long does COVID 19 virus lasts in the body?	labels: COVID-19 can spread in a few different ways. It can spread from person to person if you inhale an infected person's respiratory droplets when they sneezes, coughs, or talk. It can also spead if you touch something that an infected person has touched, like a door knob, elevator button, or bathroom faucet.That's why it's important to wash your hands, avoid touching your face, and practice social distancing to avoid getting sick. That's why it's also important to self-isolate and wear a mask around other household members if you are sick to avoid infecting other people.	episode_done:True
text: how long does COVID 19 virus lasts in the body?	labels: In the lab, these drugs have been shown to prevent the growth of the virus that causes COVID-19. There are a few reports of patients with COVID-19 who received these drugs and improved. Some are reports of groups of patients, all of whom received the drug. It is not known whether it was the drug that led to the improvement or whether there were other factors involved. We do not know if the treated patientsâ condition would have improved without the drug. To know this, there would have to be a group of similar patients who did not receive the drug (control). Because chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine may possibly help very sick patients, FDA is allowing these drugs to be provided to certain hospitalized patients under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) issued March 28, 2020. Â Under the EUA, health care providers and patients are provided with information about the risks of these drugs. However, more data from clinical trials are necessary for us to determine whether chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate are safe and effective in treating or preventing COVID-19.	episode_done:True
text: how long does COVID 19 virus lasts in the body?	labels: Together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19 by making a conscious effort to keep a physical distance between each other. Physical (social) distancing is proven to be one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of illness during an outbreak. This means making changes in your everyday routines to minimize close contact with others, including:avoiding crowded places and non-essential gatherings avoiding common greetings, such as handshakes limiting contact with people at higher risk like older adults and those in poor health keeping a distance of at least 2 arms-length (approximately 2 metres) from others	episode_done:True

text: Once you get the virus and recover from it are you still contagious for others Are you immune to it?	labels: âCurrently, there is no evidence that COVID-19 can spread through contact with imported goods. There have been no cases of COVID-19 in the United States associated with imported goods. Other coronaviruses do not survive well on surfaces. So, experts think the risk of spread from products or packages shipped over days or weeks is extremely low. Coronaviruses spread most often by small droplets of mucus from the nose and throat.	episode_done:True
text: Once you get the virus and recover from it are you still contagious for others Are you immune to it?	labels: COVID-19 is contagious and it is actively spreading from person to person.

Any hand sanitizer that has less than 60% alcohol will not be effective at killing the virus.	episode_done:True
text: Once you get the virus and recover from it are you still contagious for others Are you immune to it?	labels: Try to avoid all unnecessary travel at this time. If it is essential to travel, try to avoid contact with sick passengers, mantain as much distance as possible from other passengers, avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol.

text: How long are you contagious if you have Coronavirus?	labels: How long you should be isolated for varies on a case-by-case basis. If you have been sick with COVID-19 and have been in isolation, you should talk to your healthcare provider to decide when you can be released from isolation. Your doctor will look for signs that:-You are fever-free without taking fever-reducing medication -You no longer show symptoms -Sometimes, your doctor might recommend testing respiratory samples to decide if you can be released from isolationOnce you have been released from isolation, then you are no longer considered to be likely to infect other people.	episode_done:True

text: how much does corona virus stay on each kind of surfaces?	labels: A recent study shows that the virus can live in the air and on surfaces from several hours to several days. On plastic, it can live for up to 72 hours (3 days). On stainless steel, it can live for up to 48 hours (2 days). On cardboard, it can live up to 24 hours (1 day). On copper, it can live up to four hours. It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID-19 from these surfaces.  It is still important to regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces as well as packages and mail that come through. Remember to wash your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol based hand sanitizer (60%).	episode_done:True
text: how much does corona virus stay on each kind of surfaces?	labels: Staying at home and using "social distancing" helps stop the virus from spreading quickly. This helps to reduce the burden on healthcare systems, as there are not enough hospital workers and beds if too many people get sick at once.Social distancing means staying farther away from other people and avoiding groups of people. Since COVID-19 mostly spreads from person-to-person interactions, staying at least 6 feet away from other people can help stop the spread. It is important to use social distancing because people can spread COVID-19 even if they feel fine. It is especially important to use social distancing to protect people who are more likely to get very sick from the disease.	episode_done:True

text: What are the symptoms of covid 19?	labels: SARS-COV-2 is the name for the virus that causes the disease known as "COVID-19." Let's break it down."SARS" stands for "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome", meaning that it can cause serious problems with breathing and the lungs."COV" stands for "Coronavirus." This is the type of virus that causes COVID-19. The "2" is a way to say that this virus is different than the SARS virus that caused an outbreak in 2002-2003.	episode_done:True
text: What are the symptoms of covid 19?	labels: People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. People with mild symptoms are able to recover at home. If you experience a medical emergency such as trouble breathing, call 911 and let the operator know you may have COVID-19. For severe illness, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.Â  Currently there are no FDA-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of COVID-19. Researchers are studying new drugs, and drugs that are already approved for other health conditions, as possible treatments for COVID-19. The FDA is working with drug manufacturers, researchers, and other partners to accelerate the development process for COVID-19 treatments. CDC has more information for health care providers about these potential treatments. Never take a prescription medicine or drug if it is not prescribed for you by your doctor for your health condition.	episode_done:True
text: Why does the government think that we don t need to wear face masks when clearly citizens from countries that are able to contain the virus are all wearing face masks regardless if they are sick or not?	labels: Children under the age of 2 years should not wear any type of masks. Because babies' airways are smaller, breathing through a mask is even harder on them and they are more likely to suffocate if they use a mask. Older infants or young toddlers are not likely to keep the mask on and will likely try to remove it. This will mean they are touching their face more and could infect themselves with the virus. It is safest to keep children at home and follow social distancing.	episode_done:True
text: Why does the government think that we don t need to wear face masks when clearly citizens from countries that are able to contain the virus are all wearing face masks regardless if they are sick or not?	labels: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others. If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time. That is because there are not enough of these masks for health care workers. Health care workers need these masks to stay safe and to take care of sick patients. If you have extra surgical or N95 masks, please donate them to your local healthcare facility.	episode_done:True
text: Why does the government think that we don t need to wear face masks when clearly citizens from countries that are able to contain the virus are all wearing face masks regardless if they are sick or not?	labels: CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public when other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission of the coronavirus. The purpose of wearing cloth face coverings in public is to slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others.Â Read more about types of face masks and FDAâs emergency use authorization for non-surgical face masks.	episode_done:True

text: Does my neighbour have covid 19 symptoms?	labels: Fewer children seem to get infected by the coronavirus than adults, and most of those who do contract it have mild symptoms, if any.A very small number of children with the virus have shown symptoms associated with toxic shock or Kawasaki disease. This is a rare illness in children, according to the New York City Health Department, that involves inflammation of the blood vessels, including coronary arteries. Two studies conducted in recent weeks offer compelling evidence that children can transmit the virus. While neither proved it, many epidemiologists who were not involved in the research said that the evidence was strong enough to suggest that schools should be kept closed for now.

Let's break it down."SARS" stands for "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome", meaning that it can cause serious problems with breathing and the lungs."COV" stands for "Coronavirus." This is the type of virus that causes COVID-19. The "2" is a way to say that this virus is different than the SARS virus that caused an outbreak in 2002-2003.	episode_done:True
text: What are the symptoms of COVID 19?	labels: People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. People with mild symptoms are able to recover at home. If you experience a medical emergency such as trouble breathing, call 911 and let the operator know you may have COVID-19. For severe illness, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.Â  Currently there are no FDA-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of COVID-19. Researchers are studying new drugs, and drugs that are already approved for other health conditions, as possible treatments for COVID-19. The FDA is working with drug manufacturers, researchers, and other partners to accelerate the development process for COVID-19 treatments. CDC has more information for health care providers about these potential treatments. Never take a prescription medicine or drug if it is not prescribed for you by your doctor for your health condition.	episode_done:True
text: Should I wear a mask?	labels: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others. If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time. That is because there are not enough of these masks for health care workers. Health care workers need these masks to stay safe and to take care of sick patients. If you have extra surgical or N95 masks, please donate them to your local healthcare facility.	episode_done:True
text: Should I wear a mask?	labels: Children under the age of 2 years should not wear any type of masks. Because babies' airways are smaller, breathing through a mask is even harder on them and they are more likely to suffocate if they use a mask. Older infants or young toddlers are not likely to keep the mask on and will likely try to remove it. This will mean they are touching their face more and could infect themselves with the virus. It is safest to keep children at home and follow social distancing.	episode_done:True

text: Should I wear a mask?	labels: CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public when other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission of the coronavirus. The purpose of wearing cloth face coverings in public is to slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others.Â Read more about types of face masks and FDAâs emergency use authorization for non-surgical face masks.	episode_done:True
text: Should I wear a mask?	labels: If you are having symptoms of COVID-19, call your health care provider to be tested. If you do not have a health care provider, call 2-1-1 to be connected with a local community or hospital-connected clinic for referral to a test site. Health care providers are encouraged to order a test for any child or adult who is showing symptoms of COVID-19, even if their symptoms are mild.	episode_done:True
text: How long before the symptoms to coronavirus appear?	labels: Quarantine means staying away from other people because you might have been exposed to the virus. For COVID-19, people should quarantine for at least 14 days, or 2 weeks from the time they might have had contact with someone with COVID-19. That's because most people who get COVID-19 would have symptoms within 14 days. Scientists think that people are not likely to spread COVID-19 to others if they do not get sick after 14 days. Remember, every time you could have been exposed to the virus means you should restart your 14 day clock for quarantine.	episode_done:True
text: How long before the symptoms to coronavirus appear?	labels: How long you should be isolated for varies on a case-by-case basis. If you have been sick with COVID-19 and have been in isolation, you should talk to your healthcare provider to decide when you can be released from isolation. Your doctor will look for signs that:-You are fever-free without taking fever-reducing medication -You no longer show symptoms -Sometimes, your doctor might recommend testing respiratory samples to decide if you can be released from isolationOnce you have been released from isolation, then you are no longer considered to be likely to infect other people.	episode_done:True

text: What do I do if I have symptoms?	labels: Social distancing helps to reduce the chance of infecting people who are more likely to get severe disease. It helps to stop the virus from spreading quickly. This also helps to prevent there being too many sick people for hospitals to handle.	episode_done:True
text: What do I do if I have symptoms?	labels: Staying at home and using "social distancing" helps stop the virus from spreading quickly. This helps to reduce the burden on healthcare systems, as there are not enough hospital workers and beds if too many people get sick at once.Social distancing means staying farther away from other people and avoiding groups of people. Since COVID-19 mostly spreads from person-to-person interactions, staying at least 6 feet away from other people can help stop the spread. It is important to use social distancing because people can spread COVID-19 even if they feel fine. It is especially important to use social distancing to protect people who are more likely to get very sick from the disease.	episode_done:True
text: What do I do if I have symptoms?	labels: If you do not have any symptoms, you will be asked to:1. Self-quarantine for 14 days after you get home.2. Do not have any visitors, especially older adults, or those with health problems who are higher risk of severe illness. 3. Monitor your health for fever, cough, or trouble breathing. 4. Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use an alcohol based hand sanitizer that is at least 60% alcohol. 5. Cover your mouth and nose with your arm or a tissue when coughing or sneezing. Throw away the tissue right after and wash your hands. If you start to have symptoms like a cough or fever within the 14 days:1. Continue to self-isolate from others.2. Call a healthcare professional or a public health authority and tell them your symptoms and travel history.

COVID-19 causes some symptoms that are like getting a cold or flu. But some people get worse symptoms and need more care. COVID-19 is caused by a new type of virus that our body has not seen before. Since our body has not seen it before, our immune system has to learn how to fight off this new virus.	episode_done:True
text: How does the virus spread?	labels: COVID-19 can spread in a few different ways. It can spread from person to person if you inhale an infected person's respiratory droplets when they sneezes, coughs, or talk.

That's why it's also important to self-isolate and wear a mask around other household members if you are sick to avoid infecting other people.	episode_done:True
text: How does the virus spread?	labels: Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.	episode_done:True
text: How does the virus spread?	labels: A recent study shows that the virus can live in the air and on surfaces from several hours to several days. On plastic, it can live for up to 72 hours (3 days). On stainless steel, it can live for up to 48 hours (2 days). On cardboard, it can live up to 24 hours (1 day). On copper, it can live up to four hours. It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID-19 from these surfaces.  It is still important to regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces as well as packages and mail that come through. Remember to wash your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol based hand sanitizer (60%).	episode_done:True

text: How do you differentiate between Covid 19 and the flu?	labels: COVID-19 can spread in a few different ways. It can spread from person to person if you inhale an infected person's respiratory droplets when they sneezes, coughs, or talk. It can also spead if you touch something that an infected person has touched, like a door knob, elevator button, or bathroom faucet.That's why it's important to wash your hands, avoid touching your face, and practice social distancing to avoid getting sick. That's why it's also important to self-isolate and wear a mask around other household members if you are sick to avoid infecting other people.	episode_done:True

text: How do you differentiate between Covid 19 and the flu?	labels: You need to self-isolate if you have been confirmed to have COVID-19. Isolation is a health care term that means keeping infected people away from those who are not infected. If you have been asked to self-isolate, you should:-Stay at home except to get medical care -Stay away from other people in your home as much as you can -Wear a face mask if you need to be around other people (for example, in a doctor's office) -Cover your coughs and sneezes -Wash your hands frequently -Continue to monitor your symptoms until your doctor says you don't need to be in isolation any moreQuarantine means staying away from other people because you might have been exposed to the virus. For COVID-19, people should quarantine for at least 14 days, or 2 weeks from the time they might have had contact with someone with COVID-19. That's because most people who get COVID-19 would have symptoms within 14 days. Scientists think that people are not likely to spread COVID-19 to others if they do not get sick after 14 days.	episode_done:True
text: How likely am I to catch COVID 19?	labels: Pregnant women should do the same things as everyone else to avoid COVID-19 infection, including: Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, you can use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Clean and disinfect frequently-touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash and wash your hands. Stay home when you are sick. When you must go out, practice social distancing.	episode_done:True

text: How likely am I to catch COVID 19?	labels: Because COVID-19 is a new disease, we are still learning how it affects pregnant women. At this time, there isÂ no evidence to suggest that pregnant women are at a greater risk for more serious outcomes related to COVID-19 or that their developing child could be negatively affected by COVID-19. You can protect yourself from becoming ill by taking the following precautions:stay homeÂ as much as possible, except for important medical appointments talk to your doctor, obstetrician or midwifeÂ about the possibility of telephone or videoconference appointments avoid unnecessary visitorsÂ to your home wash your handsÂ often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds use alcohol-basedÂ hand sanitizerÂ if soap and water are not available practiseÂ physical distancingÂ by keeping a distance of at least 2 metres from others avoid touchingÂ your mouth, nose and eyes avoid crowded places and peak-hours make limited trips to the store for essentials avoid travel by public transitFor more information, refer to ourÂ advice for motherson pregnancy, childbirth and caring for newborns. If you are pregnant and concerned about COVID-19, speak to your health care provider.	episode_done:True
text: How likely am I to catch COVID 19?	labels: Generally, do not touch the body of someone who has died of COVID-19. We are still learning how COVID-19 spreads and if a deceased body can transmit the virus. One could get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it, and then touching their face (like their mouth, nose, or eyes). Try to avoid kissing washing, and shrouding the body. If washing and shrouding the body are important in your culture or religion, work with your community cultural and religious leaders as well as funeral home staff to try to reduce exposure as much as possible. People who conduct these activities should wear disposable gloves. If fluid splashing is expected, more personal protective equipment may be needed, such as disposable gowns, goggles, and face masks.	episode_done:True
text: How likely am I to catch COVID 19?	labels: If you are having symptoms of COVID-19, call your health care provider to be tested.

text: how is covid 19 spread?	labels: COVID-19 can spread in a few different ways. It can spread from person to person if you inhale an infected person's respiratory droplets when they sneezes, coughs, or talk. It can also spead if you touch something that an infected person has touched, like a door knob, elevator button, or bathroom faucet.That's why it's important to wash your hands, avoid touching your face, and practice social distancing to avoid getting sick. That's why it's also important to self-isolate and wear a mask around other household members if you are sick to avoid infecting other people.	episode_done:True
text: how is covid 19 spread?	labels: Current thinking is that COVID-19 mostly spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets. But some studies show that the virus can last on surfaces, so it is possible that someone could get the virus by touching a surface that has the virus on it and then touching their mouth, nose, or eyes.	episode_done:True
text: how is covid 19 spread?	labels: COVID-19 is contagious and it is actively spreading from person to person. The CDC recommends that those who have COVID-19 are isolated either at a hospital or at home, depending on how sick they are, until they are no longer at risk of infecting others.	episode_done:True
text: how is covid 19 spread?	labels: Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease. Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure. For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days. Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period.	episode_done:True

MERS-CoV stands for "Middle East Respiratory Syndrome- associated Coronavirus."The first cases of MERS-CoV were seen in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. MERS-CoV symptoms are fever, cough, and shortness of breath. People with this disease usually do not get sick from one another unless they are in very close contact.	episode_done:True
text: what is corona?	labels: SARS-CoV stands for "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-associated CoronaVirus." It is a virus that can cause serious problems with breathing and the lungs. It is different from the virus that has caused the COVID-19 pandemic. The SARS-CoV virus was first found in Asia in 2003 and last known human case was in China in 2004. SARS-CoV spreads through close person to person contact and caused flu like symptoms.	episode_done:True
text: what is corona?	labels: Respiratory droplets are little drops that come from your nose or mouth when you sneeze, cough, talk, or breathe.

Please keep up with local news media sources, as they will share news about school closures. If schools are closed, your child should stay home. They should avoid groups of people and avoid visiting friends or public places.	episode_done:True
text: why is the virus called COVID 19?	labels: There has been a rise in stigma and hate crimes against Chinese and other Asian Americans, as well as people who were in quarantine. This is due to lack of knowledge around how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, as well as gossip that spreads rumors and myths.Stigma hurts everyone as it creates more fear and anger towards ordinary people, instead of the disease that is causing the problem, or towards systems that are not supporting people in accessing screening and treatment.

text: Should I wear a mask?	labels: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others. If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time. That is because there are not enough of these masks for health care workers. Health care workers need these masks to stay safe and to take care of sick patients. If you have extra surgical or N95 masks, please donate them to your local healthcare facility.	episode_done:True
text: Should I wear a mask?	labels: Children under the age of 2 years should not wear any type of masks. Because babies' airways are smaller, breathing through a mask is even harder on them and they are more likely to suffocate if they use a mask. Older infants or young toddlers are not likely to keep the mask on and will likely try to remove it. This will mean they are touching their face more and could infect themselves with the virus. It is safest to keep children at home and follow social distancing.	episode_done:True

text: How long does the coronavirus last?	labels: A recent study shows that the virus can live in the air and on surfaces from several hours to several days. On plastic, it can live for up to 72 hours (3 days). On stainless steel, it can live for up to 48 hours (2 days). On cardboard, it can live up to 24 hours (1 day). On copper, it can live up to four hours. It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID-19 from these surfaces.  It is still important to regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces as well as packages and mail that come through.

MERS-CoV stands for "Middle East Respiratory Syndrome- associated Coronavirus."The first cases of MERS-CoV were seen in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. MERS-CoV symptoms are fever, cough, and shortness of breath. People with this disease usually do not get sick from one another unless they are in very close contact.	episode_done:True
text: How serious is COVID 19?	labels: You could be at higher risk of catching COVID-19 if many people have gotten COVID-19 near where you live. You could also have a higher risk if you visit places where many people are getting sick with COVID-19.Right now, in most places, the risk of catching COVID-19 is still low. But this is changing quickly in many cities and areas around the world.	episode_done:True
text: How serious is COVID 19?	labels: Because COVID-19 is a new disease, we are still learning how it affects pregnant women. At this time, there isÂ no evidence to suggest that pregnant women are at a greater risk for more serious outcomes related to COVID-19 or that their developing child could be negatively affected by COVID-19. You can protect yourself from becoming ill by taking the following precautions:stay homeÂ as much as possible, except for important medical appointments talk to your doctor, obstetrician or midwifeÂ about the possibility of telephone or videoconference appointments avoid unnecessary visitorsÂ to your home wash your handsÂ often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds use alcohol-basedÂ hand sanitizerÂ if soap and water are not available practiseÂ physical distancingÂ by keeping a distance of at least 2 metres from others avoid touchingÂ your mouth, nose and eyes avoid crowded places and peak-hours make limited trips to the store for essentials avoid travel by public transitFor more information, refer to ourÂ advice for motherson pregnancy, childbirth and caring for newborns.

text: How serious is COVID 19?	labels: COVID-19 can spread in a few different ways. It can spread from person to person if you inhale an infected person's respiratory droplets when they sneezes, coughs, or talk. It can also spead if you touch something that an infected person has touched, like a door knob, elevator button, or bathroom faucet.That's why it's important to wash your hands, avoid touching your face, and practice social distancing to avoid getting sick.

text: What surfaces is the virus most likely to stick to?	labels: A recent study shows that the virus can live in the air and on surfaces from several hours to several days. On plastic, it can live for up to 72 hours (3 days). On stainless steel, it can live for up to 48 hours (2 days). On cardboard, it can live up to 24 hours (1 day). On copper, it can live up to four hours. It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID-19 from these surfaces.  It is still important to regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces as well as packages and mail that come through. Remember to wash your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol based hand sanitizer (60%).	episode_done:True

text: Do I need to get tested if I don t have a fever?	labels: If you are having symptoms of COVID-19, call your health care provider for a referral. If you do not have a health care provider, call 2-1-1 to be connected with a local community or hospital-connected clinic for a referral to a test site. If you are having a medical emergency, call 9-1-1 or go to the hospital. Health care providers are encouraged to order a test for any child or adult who is showing symptoms of COVID-19, even if their symptoms are mild. Find out what to do if you are sick from the CDC and what to do while youÃ¢ÂÂre waiting for test results. Pop-up Testing Sites Any Vermonter without symptoms can be tested at a pop-up testing site without a doctorÃ¢ÂÂs referral. This includes people who work in Vermont, second homeowners, and college students. Registration for testing is required. For people who do not have internet access and want to register at a pop-up site, they can call 2-1-1 for help with registration. Register for a pop-up testing site. The test is a nasopharyngeal swab, or NP swab, where a health care professional uses a swab to collect a sample from the back of the nose and throat. This test will tell you if you have a current infection. It is not a serology/antibody test, which means it will not tell you if you were infected in the past. The following groups are encouraged to get tested at pop-up sites: health care workers, first responders (EMS, fire, and law enforcement), child care providers currently serving essential workers, and anyone currently under quarantine who has had no symptoms during the first seven days of quarantine. Find more details under Ã¢ÂÂI am under a 14-day quarantine. Can I have the option to be tested and end my quarantine period?Ã¢ÂÂ on this page.	episode_done:True

text: Do I need to get tested if I don t have a fever?	labels: Social distancing helps to reduce the chance of infecting people who are more likely to get severe disease. It helps to stop the virus from spreading quickly. This also helps to prevent there being too many sick people for hospitals to handle.	episode_done:True
text: Do I need to get tested if I don t have a fever?	labels: Staying at home and using "social distancing" helps stop the virus from spreading quickly. This helps to reduce the burden on healthcare systems, as there are not enough hospital workers and beds if too many people get sick at once.Social distancing means staying farther away from other people and avoiding groups of people. Since COVID-19 mostly spreads from person-to-person interactions, staying at least 6 feet away from other people can help stop the spread. It is important to use social distancing because people can spread COVID-19 even if they feel fine. It is especially important to use social distancing to protect people who are more likely to get very sick from the disease.	episode_done:True

text: Should we be wearing homemade masks when out shopping?	labels: Children under the age of 2 years should not wear any type of masks. Because babies' airways are smaller, breathing through a mask is even harder on them and they are more likely to suffocate if they use a mask. Older infants or young toddlers are not likely to keep the mask on and will likely try to remove it. This will mean they are touching their face more and could infect themselves with the virus. It is safest to keep children at home and follow social distancing.	episode_done:True
text: Should we be wearing homemade masks when out shopping?	labels: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others. If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time. That is because there are not enough of these masks for health care workers. Health care workers need these masks to stay safe and to take care of sick patients. If you have extra surgical or N95 masks, please donate them to your local healthcare facility.	episode_done:True

text: Is chloroquine effective in treating COVID-19?	labels: In the lab, these drugs have been shown to prevent the growth of the virus that causes COVID-19. There are a few reports of patients with COVID-19 who received these drugs and improved. Some are reports of groups of patients, all of whom received the drug. It is not known whether it was the drug that led to the improvement or whether there were other factors involved. We do not know if the treated patientsâ condition would have improved without the drug. To know this, there would have to be a group of similar patients who did not receive the drug (control). Because chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine may possibly help very sick patients, FDA is allowing these drugs to be provided to certain hospitalized patients under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) issued March 28, 2020. Â Under the EUA, health care providers and patients are provided with information about the risks of these drugs. However, more data from clinical trials are necessary for us to determine whether chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate are safe and effective in treating or preventing COVID-19.	episode_done:True

Have another member of your household care for your animals, if you can. 4. If it's not possible to have someone else care for your animal, always wash your hands before touching or feeding them. 5. Limit your animal's contact with other people and animals. Tthis may mean keeping them indoors.We might learn more about human to animal spread in the future. Talk to your pet's doctor if you are worried about your pet's health.	episode_done:True
text: If I get sick but it seems like a cold how long do I have to wait after feeling better to see other people?	labels: Right now, COVID-19 mostly spreads from person to person. But experts agree that the virus likely came from bats and may have passed through another type of animal in China before spreading to people. If you are going to travel, check the latest health notices for up-to-date advice before you leave. Avoid contact with animals, including wild meat and live animal markets.Animal importers, rescues, and adoptive families should limit or postpone importing animals from affected areas. If animals are imported from an affected area, monitor them closely for illness. Call a veterinarian if they get sick and call before bringing them to the office so that they can prepare.	episode_done:True
text: Can the virus travel through air or does there need to be physical contact?	labels: According to the WHO, these droplets are heavy enough that they cannot travel more than around 3 feet (1 meter). However, other research has found they can travel 23â27 feet (7â8 meters).	episode_done:True

text: I have a sore throat what other symptoms should I be waiting for before getting tested?	labels: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others. If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time. That is because there are not enough of these masks for health care workers. Health care workers need these masks to stay safe and to take care of sick patients. If you have extra surgical or N95 masks, please donate them to your local healthcare facility.	episode_done:True

text: How long goes the virus stay in the air after someone coughs?	labels: Generally, do not touch the body of someone who has died of COVID-19. We are still learning how COVID-19 spreads and if a deceased body can transmit the virus. One could get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it, and then touching their face (like their mouth, nose, or eyes). Try to avoid kissing washing, and shrouding the body. If washing and shrouding the body are important in your culture or religion, work with your community cultural and religious leaders as well as funeral home staff to try to reduce exposure as much as possible. People who conduct these activities should wear disposable gloves. If fluid splashing is expected, more personal protective equipment may be needed, such as disposable gowns, goggles, and face masks.	episode_done:True
text: How long goes the virus stay in the air after someone coughs?	labels: The time between exposure to the COVID-19 virus and onset of symptoms is called the âincubation period.â The incubation period for COVID-19 is typically 2 to 14 days, although in some cases it may be longer.	episode_done:True
text: How long goes the virus stay in the air after someone coughs?	labels: Most people who get COVID-19 will be able to recover at home.

Since COVID-19 mostly spreads from person-to-person interactions, staying at least 6 feet away from other people can help stop the spread. It is important to use social distancing because people can spread COVID-19 even if they feel fine. It is especially important to use social distancing to protect people who are more likely to get very sick from the disease.	episode_done:True

text: Do I need to disinfect food?	labels: If you do not have any symptoms, you will be asked to:1. Self-quarantine for 14 days after you get home.2. Do not have any visitors, especially older adults, or those with health problems who are higher risk of severe illness. 3. Monitor your health for fever, cough, or trouble breathing. 4. Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use an alcohol based hand sanitizer that is at least 60% alcohol. 5. Cover your mouth and nose with your arm or a tissue when coughing or sneezing. Throw away the tissue right after and wash your hands. If you start to have symptoms like a cough or fever within the 14 days:1. Continue to self-isolate from others.2. Call a healthcare professional or a public health authority and tell them your symptoms and travel history. Follow their instructions.3.If your symptoms are severe - such as pain or pressure in the chest that won't go away, trouble breathing, feeling confused or unable to arouse, or lips or face that look blue, seek medical care right away.

text: Do I need to disinfect food?	labels: Social distancing helps to reduce the chance of infecting people who are more likely to get severe disease. It helps to stop the virus from spreading quickly. This also helps to prevent there being too many sick people for hospitals to handle.	episode_done:True
text: Do I need to disinfect food?	labels: Staying at home and using "social distancing" helps stop the virus from spreading quickly. This helps to reduce the burden on healthcare systems, as there are not enough hospital workers and beds if too many people get sick at once.Social distancing means staying farther away from other people and avoiding groups of people. Since COVID-19 mostly spreads from person-to-person interactions, staying at least 6 feet away from other people can help stop the spread. It is important to use social distancing because people can spread COVID-19 even if they feel fine. It is especially important to use social distancing to protect people who are more likely to get very sick from the disease.	episode_done:True
text: Do I need to disinfect food?	labels: Current thinking is that COVID-19 mostly spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets.

text: What are COVID symptoms at early stage?	labels: SARS-COV-2 is the name for the virus that causes the disease known as "COVID-19." Let's break it down."SARS" stands for "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome", meaning that it can cause serious problems with breathing and the lungs."COV" stands for "Coronavirus." This is the type of virus that causes COVID-19. The "2" is a way to say that this virus is different than the SARS virus that caused an outbreak in 2002-2003.	episode_done:True
text: What are COVID symptoms at early stage?	labels: People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. People with mild symptoms are able to recover at home. If you experience a medical emergency such as trouble breathing, call 911 and let the operator know you may have COVID-19. For severe illness, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.Â  Currently there are no FDA-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of COVID-19. Researchers are studying new drugs, and drugs that are already approved for other health conditions, as possible treatments for COVID-19. The FDA is working with drug manufacturers, researchers, and other partners to accelerate the development process for COVID-19 treatments. CDC has more information for health care providers about these potential treatments. Never take a prescription medicine or drug if it is not prescribed for you by your doctor for your health condition.	episode_done:True
text: How long does the virus stay on surface?	labels: Current thinking is that COVID-19 mostly spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets. But some studies show that the virus can last on surfaces, so it is possible that someone could get the virus by touching a surface that has the virus on it and then touching their mouth, nose, or eyes.	episode_done:True
text: How long does the virus stay on surface?	labels: A recent study shows that the virus can live in the air and on surfaces from several hours to several days. On plastic, it can live for up to 72 hours (3 days). On stainless steel, it can live for up to 48 hours (2 days). On cardboard, it can live up to 24 hours (1 day). On copper, it can live up to four hours. It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID-19 from these surfaces.  It is still important to regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces as well as packages and mail that come through. Remember to wash your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol based hand sanitizer (60%).	episode_done:True

Your doctor will look for signs that:-You are fever-free without taking fever-reducing medication -You no longer show symptoms -Sometimes, your doctor might recommend testing respiratory samples to decide if you can be released from isolationOnce you have been released from isolation, then you are no longer considered to be likely to infect other people.	episode_done:True
text: How long does the virus stay on surface?	labels: COVID-19 can spread in a few different ways. It can spread from person to person if you inhale an infected person's respiratory droplets when they sneezes, coughs, or talk. It can also spead if you touch something that an infected person has touched, like a door knob, elevator button, or bathroom faucet.That's why it's important to wash your hands, avoid touching your face, and practice social distancing to avoid getting sick.

This means that the body needs to learn how to fight off this new type of virus.	episode_done:True
text: What are de symptoms of coronavirus?	labels: People might be able to spread the disease before people realize they are sick. But most scientists think that people are most likely to infect others when they have symptoms and feel sick. Canada public health services is doing research to try to answer this question.	episode_done:True
text: How fast does the virus spread?	labels: COVID-19 can spread in a few different ways. It can spread from person to person if you inhale an infected person's respiratory droplets when they sneezes, coughs, or talk. It can also spead if you touch something that an infected person has touched, like a door knob, elevator button, or bathroom faucet.That's why it's important to wash your hands, avoid touching your face, and practice social distancing to avoid getting sick. That's why it's also important to self-isolate and wear a mask around other household members if you are sick to avoid infecting other people.	episode_done:True
text: How fast does the virus spread?	labels: Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.	episode_done:True
text: How fast does the virus spread?	labels: A recent study shows that the virus can live in the air and on surfaces from several hours to several days. On plastic, it can live for up to 72 hours (3 days). On stainless steel, it can live for up to 48 hours (2 days). On cardboard, it can live up to 24 hours (1 day). On copper, it can live up to four hours. It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID-19 from these surfaces.  It is still important to regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces as well as packages and mail that come through. Remember to wash your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol based hand sanitizer (60%).	episode_done:True
text: How fast does the virus spread?	labels: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others. If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time. That is because there are not enough of these masks for health care workers. Health care workers need these masks to stay safe and to take care of sick patients. If you have extra surgical or N95 masks, please donate them to your local healthcare facility.	episode_done:True
text: How fast does the virus spread?	labels: Current thinking is that COVID-19 mostly spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets. But some studies show that the virus can last on surfaces, so it is possible that someone could get the virus by touching a surface that has the virus on it and then touching their mouth, nose, or eyes.	episode_done:True
text: My mom came back from a trip on the 20th of March Until when is she supposed to stay home?	labels: Staying at home and using "social distancing" helps stop the virus from spreading quickly. This helps to reduce the burden on healthcare systems, as there are not enough hospital workers and beds if too many people get sick at once.Social distancing means staying farther away from other people and avoiding groups of people. Since COVID-19 mostly spreads from person-to-person interactions, staying at least 6 feet away from other people can help stop the spread. It is important to use social distancing because people can spread COVID-19 even if they feel fine. It is especially important to use social distancing to protect people who are more likely to get very sick from the disease.	episode_done:True

text: what are he covid symptoms?	labels: Those who are infected with COVID-19 may have little to no symptoms. You may not know you have symptoms of COVID-19 because they are similar to a cold or flu. Symptoms haveincluded:cough fever difficulty breathing pneumonia in both lungsIn severe cases, infection can leadto death.Symptoms may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to COVID-19. This is the longest known incubation period for this disease.Recent evidence indicates that the virus can be transmitted to othersfrom someone who is infected but not showing symptoms. This includes peoplewho:have not yet developed symptoms (pre-symptomatic) never develop symptoms (asymptomatic)While experts know that these kinds of transmissions are happening amongthose in close contact or in close physical settings, it is not known to whatextent.

text: what are he covid symptoms?	labels: People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. People with mild symptoms are able to recover at home. If you experience a medical emergency such as trouble breathing, call 911 and let the operator know you may have COVID-19. For severe illness, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.Â  Currently there are no FDA-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of COVID-19. Researchers are studying new drugs, and drugs that are already approved for other health conditions, as possible treatments for COVID-19. The FDA is working with drug manufacturers, researchers, and other partners to accelerate the development process for COVID-19 treatments. CDC has more information for health care providers about these potential treatments. Never take a prescription medicine or drug if it is not prescribed for you by your doctor for your health condition.	episode_done:True

This includes when you're inside a store or outside for exercise. The COVID-19 virus spreads easily from person-to-person. It travels through the air when a sick person coughs, sneezes or talks. One way to contain the spread of COVID-19 is to stop people from sharing it. Without a vaccine or treatment, we can help contain the virus by: Staying at home to protect others if you are sick. Staying home is still the best way to lower our risk of COVID-19, but small groups of 10 or fewer people are now allowed if health and safety precautions are followed. Learn how to safely connect with friends and family. Continuing to go outside, take walks, do essential errands while maintaining a physical distance from others and practicing proper hygiene.

text: How long does covid live on packages?	labels: In the lab, these drugs have been shown to prevent the growth of the virus that causes COVID-19. There are a few reports of patients with COVID-19 who received these drugs and improved. Some are reports of groups of patients, all of whom received the drug. It is not known whether it was the drug that led to the improvement or whether there were other factors involved. We do not know if the treated patientsâ condition would have improved without the drug. To know this, there would have to be a group of similar patients who did not receive the drug (control). Because chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine may possibly help very sick patients, FDA is allowing these drugs to be provided to certain hospitalized patients under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) issued March 28, 2020. Â Under the EUA, health care providers and patients are provided with information about the risks of these drugs. However, more data from clinical trials are necessary for us to determine whether chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate are safe and effective in treating or preventing COVID-19.	episode_done:True
text: How long does covid live on packages?	labels: Together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19 by making a conscious effort to keep a physical distance between each other. Physical (social) distancing is proven to be one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of illness during an outbreak. This means making changes in your everyday routines to minimize close contact with others, including:avoiding crowded places and non-essential gatherings avoiding common greetings, such as handshakes limiting contact with people at higher risk like older adults and those in poor health keeping a distance of at least 2 arms-length (approximately 2 metres) from others	episode_done:True

There was a tiger in a zoo in New York City that seems to have gotten COVID-19 from its caretakers. To be safe, wash your hands before and after touching animals. Until we know more, if you have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and have a pet or other animal, you should:1. Avoid close contact with them. Do not snuggle or kiss them, let them lick you, sit on your lap, or sleep in your bed. 2. Avoid coughing and sneezing on your animals. Cover your coughs and sneezes. 3. Have another member of your household care for your animals, if you can. 4. If it's not possible to have someone else care for your animal, always wash your hands before touching or feeding them. 5.

Let's break it down."SARS" stands for "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome", meaning that it can cause serious problems with breathing and the lungs."COV" stands for "Coronavirus." This is the type of virus that causes COVID-19. The "2" is a way to say that this virus is different than the SARS virus that caused an outbreak in 2002-2003.	episode_done:True
text: What are the most common COVID 19 symptoms?	labels: People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. People with mild symptoms are able to recover at home. If you experience a medical emergency such as trouble breathing, call 911 and let the operator know you may have COVID-19. For severe illness, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.Â  Currently there are no FDA-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of COVID-19. Researchers are studying new drugs, and drugs that are already approved for other health conditions, as possible treatments for COVID-19. The FDA is working with drug manufacturers, researchers, and other partners to accelerate the development process for COVID-19 treatments.

text: What are the early symptoms of COVID 19?	labels: People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. People with mild symptoms are able to recover at home. If you experience a medical emergency such as trouble breathing, call 911 and let the operator know you may have COVID-19. For severe illness, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.Â  Currently there are no FDA-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of COVID-19. Researchers are studying new drugs, and drugs that are already approved for other health conditions, as possible treatments for COVID-19. The FDA is working with drug manufacturers, researchers, and other partners to accelerate the development process for COVID-19 treatments. CDC has more information for health care providers about these potential treatments. Never take a prescription medicine or drug if it is not prescribed for you by your doctor for your health condition.	episode_done:True

On copper, it can live up to four hours. It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID-19 from these surfaces.  It is still important to regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces as well as packages and mail that come through. Remember to wash your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol based hand sanitizer (60%).	episode_done:True
text: Are there any long term effects?	labels: Quarantine means staying away from other people because you might have been exposed to the virus. For COVID-19, people should quarantine for at least 14 days, or 2 weeks from the time they might have had contact with someone with COVID-19. That's because most people who get COVID-19 would have symptoms within 14 days. Scientists think that people are not likely to spread COVID-19 to others if they do not get sick after 14 days. Remember, every time you could have been exposed to the virus means you should restart your 14 day clock for quarantine.	episode_done:True

This includes when you're inside a store or outside for exercise. The COVID-19 virus spreads easily from person-to-person. It travels through the air when a sick person coughs, sneezes or talks. One way to contain the spread of COVID-19 is to stop people from sharing it. Without a vaccine or treatment, we can help contain the virus by: Staying at home to protect others if you are sick. Staying home is still the best way to lower our risk of COVID-19, but small groups of 10 or fewer people are now allowed if health and safety precautions are followed. Learn how to safely connect with friends and family. Continuing to go outside, take walks, do essential errands while maintaining a physical distance from others and practicing proper hygiene. Remember that ticks are active this time of year. Find out how to Be Tick Smart and prevent tick bites.

It can also spead if you touch something that an infected person has touched, like a door knob, elevator button, or bathroom faucet.That's why it's important to wash your hands, avoid touching your face, and practice social distancing to avoid getting sick. That's why it's also important to self-isolate and wear a mask around other household members if you are sick to avoid infecting other people.	episode_done:True
text: How long does the virus live on surfaces?	labels: Together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19 by making a conscious effort to keep a physical distance between each other. Physical (social) distancing is proven to be one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of illness during an outbreak. This means making changes in your everyday routines to minimize close contact with others, including:avoiding crowded places and non-essential gatherings avoiding common greetings, such as handshakes limiting contact with people at higher risk like older adults and those in poor health keeping a distance of at least 2 arms-length (approximately 2 metres) from others	episode_done:True
text: How long does the virus live on surfaces?	labels: Self-isolation means that people who are sick stay away from those who are not sick. This helps to keep the disease from spreading. If someone has asked you to self-isolate, you should:-Stay at home except to get medical care -Stay away from other people in your home as much as you can -Wear a face mask if you have to be around other people (for example, in a doctor's office) -Cover your coughs and sneezes -Wash your hands a lot -Keep track of your symptomsGo here to read more about how you should self-isolate, visit this page: https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/steps-when-sick.html	episode_done:True
text: can I get infected from a newspaper?	labels: Right now, COVID-19 mostly spreads from person to person. But experts agree that the virus likely came from bats and may have passed through another type of animal in China before spreading to people. If you are going to travel, check the latest health notices for up-to-date advice before you leave. Avoid contact with animals, including wild meat and live animal markets.Animal importers, rescues, and adoptive families should limit or postpone importing animals from affected areas. If animals are imported from an affected area, monitor them closely for illness. Call a veterinarian if they get sick and call before bringing them to the office so that they can prepare.	episode_done:True
text: can I get infected from a newspaper?	labels: If you are having symptoms of COVID-19, call your health care provider for a referral. If you do not have a health care provider, call 2-1-1 to be connected with a local community or hospital-connected clinic for a referral to a test site. If you are having a medical emergency, call 9-1-1 or go to the hospital. Health care providers are encouraged to order a test for any child or adult who is showing symptoms of COVID-19, even if their symptoms are mild. Find out what to do if you are sick from the CDC and what to do while youÃ¢ÂÂre waiting for test results. Pop-up Testing Sites Any Vermonter without symptoms can be tested at a pop-up testing site without a doctorÃ¢ÂÂs referral. This includes people who work in Vermont, second homeowners, and college students. Registration for testing is required. For people who do not have internet access and want to register at a pop-up site, they can call 2-1-1 for help with registration. Register for a pop-up testing site. The test is a nasopharyngeal swab, or NP swab, where a health care professional uses a swab to collect a sample from the back of the nose and throat. This test will tell you if you have a current infection. It is not a serology/antibody test, which means it will not tell you if you were infected in the past. The following groups are encouraged to get tested at pop-up sites: health care workers, first responders (EMS, fire, and law enforcement), child care providers currently serving essential workers, and anyone currently under quarantine who has had no symptoms during the first seven days of quarantine. Find more details under Ã¢ÂÂI am under a 14-day quarantine. Can I have the option to be tested and end my quarantine period?Ã¢ÂÂ on this page.	episode_done:True
text: can I get infected from a newspaper?	labels: Right now, we don't know of any clear cases of the virus passing from people to their pets. There was a tiger in a zoo in New York City that seems to have gotten COVID-19 from its caretakers. To be safe, wash your hands before and after touching animals. Until we know more, if you have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and have a pet or other animal, you should:1. Avoid close contact with them. Do not snuggle or kiss them, let them lick you, sit on your lap, or sleep in your bed. 2. Avoid coughing and sneezing on your animals. Cover your coughs and sneezes. 3. Have another member of your household care for your animals, if you can. 4. If it's not possible to have someone else care for your animal, always wash your hands before touching or feeding them. 5. Limit your animal's contact with other people and animals. Tthis may mean keeping them indoors.We might learn more about human to animal spread in the future.

text: I ve had a mild case of pneumonia before I m 30 years old Am I at any additional risk?	labels: Generally, do not touch the body of someone who has died of COVID-19. We are still learning how COVID-19 spreads and if a deceased body can transmit the virus. One could get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it, and then touching their face (like their mouth, nose, or eyes). Try to avoid kissing washing, and shrouding the body. If washing and shrouding the body are important in your culture or religion, work with your community cultural and religious leaders as well as funeral home staff to try to reduce exposure as much as possible. People who conduct these activities should wear disposable gloves. If fluid splashing is expected, more personal protective equipment may be needed, such as disposable gowns, goggles, and face masks.	episode_done:True
text: Is it best to stay at home if I have symptoms?	labels: Staying at home and using "social distancing" helps stop the virus from spreading quickly. This helps to reduce the burden on healthcare systems, as there are not enough hospital workers and beds if too many people get sick at once.Social distancing means staying farther away from other people and avoiding groups of people. Since COVID-19 mostly spreads from person-to-person interactions, staying at least 6 feet away from other people can help stop the spread. It is important to use social distancing because people can spread COVID-19 even if they feel fine. It is especially important to use social distancing to protect people who are more likely to get very sick from the disease.	episode_done:True

text: How long the virus stays on surfaces?	labels: A recent study shows that the virus can live in the air and on surfaces from several hours to several days. On plastic, it can live for up to 72 hours (3 days). On stainless steel, it can live for up to 48 hours (2 days). On cardboard, it can live up to 24 hours (1 day). On copper, it can live up to four hours. It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID-19 from these surfaces.  It is still important to regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces as well as packages and mail that come through. Remember to wash your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol based hand sanitizer (60%).	episode_done:True
text: How long the virus stays on surfaces?	labels: How long you should be isolated for varies on a case-by-case basis.

Your doctor will look for signs that:-You are fever-free without taking fever-reducing medication -You no longer show symptoms -Sometimes, your doctor might recommend testing respiratory samples to decide if you can be released from isolationOnce you have been released from isolation, then you are no longer considered to be likely to infect other people.	episode_done:True
text: How long the virus stays on surfaces?	labels: Quarantine means staying away from other people because you might have been exposed to the virus. For COVID-19, people should quarantine for at least 14 days, or 2 weeks from the time they might have had contact with someone with COVID-19. That's because most people who get COVID-19 would have symptoms within 14 days. Scientists think that people are not likely to spread COVID-19 to others if they do not get sick after 14 days. Remember, every time you could have been exposed to the virus means you should restart your 14 day clock for quarantine.	episode_done:True

text: what is social distancing?	labels: Social distancing means maintaining a physical distance (approximately 6 feet or 2 meters) from others you do not live with. This includes when you're inside a store or outside for exercise. The COVID-19 virus spreads easily from person-to-person. It travels through the air when a sick person coughs, sneezes or talks. One way to contain the spread of COVID-19 is to stop people from sharing it. Without a vaccine or treatment, we can help contain the virus by: Staying at home to protect others if you are sick. Staying home is still the best way to lower our risk of COVID-19, but small groups of 10 or fewer people are now allowed if health and safety precautions are followed. Learn how to safely connect with friends and family. Continuing to go outside, take walks, do essential errands while maintaining a physical distance from others and practicing proper hygiene.

text: Is washing my hands really the best way to prevent transmission?	labels: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others. If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time. That is because there are not enough of these masks for health care workers. Health care workers need these masks to stay safe and to take care of sick patients. If you have extra surgical or N95 masks, please donate them to your local healthcare facility.	episode_done:True

text: My father has Type 2 diabetes It isn t very severe but I am still concerned for his health Is this type of diabetes considered an underlying condition?	labels: Generally, do not touch the body of someone who has died of COVID-19. We are still learning how COVID-19 spreads and if a deceased body can transmit the virus. One could get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it, and then touching their face (like their mouth, nose, or eyes). Try to avoid kissing washing, and shrouding the body. If washing and shrouding the body are important in your culture or religion, work with your community cultural and religious leaders as well as funeral home staff to try to reduce exposure as much as possible. People who conduct these activities should wear disposable gloves. If fluid splashing is expected, more personal protective equipment may be needed, such as disposable gowns, goggles, and face masks.	episode_done:True

text: How long does COVID 19 stay on surfaces?	labels: COVID-19 can spread in a few different ways. It can spread from person to person if you inhale an infected person's respiratory droplets when they sneezes, coughs, or talk. It can also spead if you touch something that an infected person has touched, like a door knob, elevator button, or bathroom faucet.That's why it's important to wash your hands, avoid touching your face, and practice social distancing to avoid getting sick.

text: How long does COVID 19 stay on surfaces?	labels: In the lab, these drugs have been shown to prevent the growth of the virus that causes COVID-19. There are a few reports of patients with COVID-19 who received these drugs and improved. Some are reports of groups of patients, all of whom received the drug. It is not known whether it was the drug that led to the improvement or whether there were other factors involved. We do not know if the treated patientsâ condition would have improved without the drug. To know this, there would have to be a group of similar patients who did not receive the drug (control). Because chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine may possibly help very sick patients, FDA is allowing these drugs to be provided to certain hospitalized patients under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) issued March 28, 2020. Â Under the EUA, health care providers and patients are provided with information about the risks of these drugs. However, more data from clinical trials are necessary for us to determine whether chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate are safe and effective in treating or preventing COVID-19.	episode_done:True

On copper, it can live up to four hours. It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID-19 from these surfaces.  It is still important to regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces as well as packages and mail that come through.

text: Should we avoid online shopping as it puts workings and delivery people at risk?	labels: Quarantine means staying away from other people because you might have been exposed to the virus. For COVID-19, people should quarantine for at least 14 days, or 2 weeks from the time they might have had contact with someone with COVID-19. That's because most people who get COVID-19 would have symptoms within 14 days. Scientists think that people are not likely to spread COVID-19 to others if they do not get sick after 14 days. Remember, every time you could have been exposed to the virus means you should restart your 14 day clock for quarantine.	episode_done:True

text: What are the criteria for swabbing children?	labels: Children under the age of 2 years should not wear any type of masks. Because babies' airways are smaller, breathing through a mask is even harder on them and they are more likely to suffocate if they use a mask. Older infants or young toddlers are not likely to keep the mask on and will likely try to remove it. This will mean they are touching their face more and could infect themselves with the virus. It is safest to keep children at home and follow social distancing.	episode_done:True

If you are going to travel, check the latest health notices for up-to-date advice before you leave. Avoid contact with animals, including wild meat and live animal markets.Animal importers, rescues, and adoptive families should limit or postpone importing animals from affected areas. If animals are imported from an affected area, monitor them closely for illness. Call a veterinarian if they get sick and call before bringing them to the office so that they can prepare.	episode_done:True
text: Can I get the virus from food?	labels: If you are having symptoms of COVID-19, call your health care provider for a referral. If you do not have a health care provider, call 2-1-1 to be connected with a local community or hospital-connected clinic for a referral to a test site. If you are having a medical emergency, call 9-1-1 or go to the hospital. Health care providers are encouraged to order a test for any child or adult who is showing symptoms of COVID-19, even if their symptoms are mild. Find out what to do if you are sick from the CDC and what to do while youÃ¢ÂÂre waiting for test results. Pop-up Testing Sites Any Vermonter without symptoms can be tested at a pop-up testing site without a doctorÃ¢ÂÂs referral. This includes people who work in Vermont, second homeowners, and college students. Registration for testing is required. For people who do not have internet access and want to register at a pop-up site, they can call 2-1-1 for help with registration. Register for a pop-up testing site. The test is a nasopharyngeal swab, or NP swab, where a health care professional uses a swab to collect a sample from the back of the nose and throat. This test will tell you if you have a current infection. It is not a serology/antibody test, which means it will not tell you if you were infected in the past. The following groups are encouraged to get tested at pop-up sites: health care workers, first responders (EMS, fire, and law enforcement), child care providers currently serving essential workers, and anyone currently under quarantine who has had no symptoms during the first seven days of quarantine. Find more details under Ã¢ÂÂI am under a 14-day quarantine. Can I have the option to be tested and end my quarantine period?Ã¢ÂÂ on this page.	episode_done:True
text: Can I get the virus from food?	labels: Right now, we don't know of any clear cases of the virus passing from people to their pets. There was a tiger in a zoo in New York City that seems to have gotten COVID-19 from its caretakers. To be safe, wash your hands before and after touching animals. Until we know more, if you have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and have a pet or other animal, you should:1. Avoid close contact with them. Do not snuggle or kiss them, let them lick you, sit on your lap, or sleep in your bed. 2. Avoid coughing and sneezing on your animals. Cover your coughs and sneezes. 3. Have another member of your household care for your animals, if you can. 4. If it's not possible to have someone else care for your animal, always wash your hands before touching or feeding them. 5. Limit your animal's contact with other people and animals. Tthis may mean keeping them indoors.We might learn more about human to animal spread in the future. Talk to your pet's doctor if you are worried about your pet's health.	episode_done:True

text: How long does COVID 19 stay in the air?	labels: In the lab, these drugs have been shown to prevent the growth of the virus that causes COVID-19. There are a few reports of patients with COVID-19 who received these drugs and improved. Some are reports of groups of patients, all of whom received the drug. It is not known whether it was the drug that led to the improvement or whether there were other factors involved. We do not know if the treated patientsâ condition would have improved without the drug. To know this, there would have to be a group of similar patients who did not receive the drug (control). Because chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine may possibly help very sick patients, FDA is allowing these drugs to be provided to certain hospitalized patients under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) issued March 28, 2020. Â Under the EUA, health care providers and patients are provided with information about the risks of these drugs. However, more data from clinical trials are necessary for us to determine whether chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate are safe and effective in treating or preventing COVID-19.	episode_done:True
text: How long does COVID 19 stay in the air?	labels: Together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19 by making a conscious effort to keep a physical distance between each other.

text: If I do not have systoms could I still have the virus?	labels: Staying at home and using "social distancing" helps stop the virus from spreading quickly. This helps to reduce the burden on healthcare systems, as there are not enough hospital workers and beds if too many people get sick at once.Social distancing means staying farther away from other people and avoiding groups of people. Since COVID-19 mostly spreads from person-to-person interactions, staying at least 6 feet away from other people can help stop the spread. It is important to use social distancing because people can spread COVID-19 even if they feel fine. It is especially important to use social distancing to protect people who are more likely to get very sick from the disease.	episode_done:True

text: Do we need to prevent touching packing of food does corona virus lie on packing And on clothes?	labels: Current thinking is that COVID-19 mostly spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets. But some studies show that the virus can last on surfaces, so it is possible that someone could get the virus by touching a surface that has the virus on it and then touching their mouth, nose, or eyes.	episode_done:True
text: Do we need to prevent touching packing of food does corona virus lie on packing And on clothes?	labels: A recent study shows that the virus can live in the air and on surfaces from several hours to several days. On plastic, it can live for up to 72 hours (3 days). On stainless steel, it can live for up to 48 hours (2 days). On cardboard, it can live up to 24 hours (1 day). On copper, it can live up to four hours. It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID-19 from these surfaces.  It is still important to regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces as well as packages and mail that come through. Remember to wash your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol based hand sanitizer (60%).	episode_done:True

text: What are the symptoms of Covid 19?	labels: People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. People with mild symptoms are able to recover at home. If you experience a medical emergency such as trouble breathing, call 911 and let the operator know you may have COVID-19. For severe illness, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.Â  Currently there are no FDA-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of COVID-19. Researchers are studying new drugs, and drugs that are already approved for other health conditions, as possible treatments for COVID-19. The FDA is working with drug manufacturers, researchers, and other partners to accelerate the development process for COVID-19 treatments. CDC has more information for health care providers about these potential treatments. Never take a prescription medicine or drug if it is not prescribed for you by your doctor for your health condition.	episode_done:True

It is not known whether it was the drug that led to the improvement or whether there were other factors involved. We do not know if the treated patientsâ condition would have improved without the drug. To know this, there would have to be a group of similar patients who did not receive the drug (control). Because chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine may possibly help very sick patients, FDA is allowing these drugs to be provided to certain hospitalized patients under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) issued March 28, 2020. Â Under the EUA, health care providers and patients are provided with information about the risks of these drugs.
