text: How long will we have to stay inside?	labels: Staying at home and using "social distancing" helps stop the virus from spreading quickly. This helps to reduce the burden on healthcare systems, as there are not enough hospital workers and beds if too many people get sick at once.Social distancing means staying farther away from other people and avoiding groups of people. Since COVID-19 mostly spreads from person-to-person interactions, staying at least 6 feet away from other people can help stop the spread. It is important to use social distancing because people can spread COVID-19 even if they feel fine. It is especially important to use social distancing to protect people who are more likely to get very sick from the disease.	episode_done:True
text: How long will we have to stay inside?	labels: How long you should be isolated for varies on a case-by-case basis. If you have been sick with COVID-19 and have been in isolation, you should talk to your healthcare provider to decide when you can be released from isolation. Your doctor will look for signs that:-You are fever-free without taking fever-reducing medication -You no longer show symptoms -Sometimes, your doctor might recommend testing respiratory samples to decide if you can be released from isolationOnce you have been released from isolation, then you are no longer considered to be likely to infect other people.	episode_done:True
text: How long will we have to stay inside?	labels: Quarantine means staying away from other people because you might have been exposed to the virus. For COVID-19, people should quarantine for at least 14 days, or 2 weeks from the time they might have had contact with someone with COVID-19. That's because most people who get COVID-19 would have symptoms within 14 days. Scientists think that people are not likely to spread COVID-19 to others if they do not get sick after 14 days. Remember, every time you could have been exposed to the virus means you should restart your 14 day clock for quarantine.	episode_done:True
text: How long will we have to stay inside?	labels: A recent study shows that the virus can live in the air and on surfaces from several hours to several days. On plastic, it can live for up to 72 hours (3 days). On stainless steel, it can live for up to 48 hours (2 days). On cardboard, it can live up to 24 hours (1 day). On copper, it can live up to four hours. It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID-19 from these surfaces.  It is still important to regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces as well as packages and mail that come through. Remember to wash your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol based hand sanitizer (60%).	episode_done:True
text: What is COVID 19 test?	labels: In general, a negative or normal result means that the virus that causes COVID-19 was not found in the sample. But sometimes if a person has COVID-19 in the early stages, they could test negative at first, but test positive later on, when there is more virus present. You healthcare provider can help decide if you should be tested again.	episode_done:True
text: What is COVID 19 test?	labels: COVID-19 is a disease caused by a new type of virus. Sometimes people also call it "coronavirus," which is is the type of virus that causes COVID-19. COVID-19 causes some symptoms that are like getting a cold or flu. But some people get worse symptoms and need more care. COVID-19 is caused by a new type of virus that our body has not seen before. Since our body has not seen it before, our immune system has to learn how to fight off this new virus.	episode_done:True

This is the type of virus that causes COVID-19. The "2" is a way to say that this virus is different than the SARS virus that caused an outbreak in 2002-2003.	episode_done:True
text: What is COVID 19 test?	labels: People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. People with mild symptoms are able to recover at home. If you experience a medical emergency such as trouble breathing, call 911 and let the operator know you may have COVID-19. For severe illness, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.  Currently there are no FDA-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of COVID-19. Researchers are studying new drugs, and drugs that are already approved for other health conditions, as possible treatments for COVID-19. The FDA is working with drug manufacturers, researchers, and other partners to accelerate the development process for COVID-19 treatments. CDC has more information for health care providers about these potential treatments. Never take a prescription medicine or drug if it is not prescribed for you by your doctor for your health condition.	episode_done:True

text: I am a 62 year old female currently in excellent health I have had a history of chronic bronchitis and pneumonia but it s been over a decade since my last issue I have two adult children who may have to move back home How do I protect myself against what they my bring home?	labels: Generally, do not touch the body of someone who has died of COVID-19. We are still learning how COVID-19 spreads and if a deceased body can transmit the virus. One could get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it, and then touching their face (like their mouth, nose, or eyes). Try to avoid kissing washing, and shrouding the body. If washing and shrouding the body are important in your culture or religion, work with your community cultural and religious leaders as well as funeral home staff to try to reduce exposure as much as possible. People who conduct these activities should wear disposable gloves. If fluid splashing is expected, more personal protective equipment may be needed, such as disposable gowns, goggles, and face masks.	episode_done:True
text: How to differentiate between coronavirus and simple flu?	labels: You need to self-isolate if you have been confirmed to have COVID-19. Isolation is a health care term that means keeping infected people away from those who are not infected. If you have been asked to self-isolate, you should:-Stay at home except to get medical care -Stay away from other people in your home as much as you can -Wear a face mask if you need to be around other people (for example, in a doctor's office) -Cover your coughs and sneezes -Wash your hands frequently -Continue to monitor your symptoms until your doctor says you don't need to be in isolation any moreQuarantine means staying away from other people because you might have been exposed to the virus. For COVID-19, people should quarantine for at least 14 days, or 2 weeks from the time they might have had contact with someone with COVID-19.

text: How to differentiate between coronavirus and simple flu?	labels: The difference between self-monitoring and self-isolation is based on whether you have been diagnosed with COVID-19 or not. If you may have been exposed to COVID-19 but don't have symptoms, you should self-monitor. If you have been diagnosed with COVID-19, you should self-isolate.You need to self-monitor if you have no symptoms but may have been exposed to COVID-19 in the last 14 days or are in close contact with older adults, people who are medically vulnerable or have been asked to do so by your Public Health Authority. Self-monitoring means you should:-Monitor yourself for 14 days for symptoms like fever, cough, and trouble breathing -Stay at home -Avoid crowded places -Stay at least 6 feet away from others as much as you can -Wash your hands frequentlyYou need to self-isolate if you have been confirmed to have COVID-19.

text: How to differentiate between coronavirus and simple flu?	labels: COVID-19 can spread in a few different ways. It can spread from person to person if you inhale an infected person's respiratory droplets when they sneezes, coughs, or talk. It can also spead if you touch something that an infected person has touched, like a door knob, elevator button, or bathroom faucet.That's why it's important to wash your hands, avoid touching your face, and practice social distancing to avoid getting sick. That's why it's also important to self-isolate and wear a mask around other household members if you are sick to avoid infecting other people.	episode_done:True
text: Does covid 19 spread in warm weather?	labels: Scientists are still looking into this. Some studies suggest that warmer places account for a smaller share of global cases and have had slower infection rates. But none of these findings have been peer-reviewed yet. And even if a certain temperature and humidity diminished the spread, that wouldn’t preclude the virus’ return when the weather cools again.	episode_done:True

text: Does covid 19 spread in warm weather?	labels: In the lab, these drugs have been shown to prevent the growth of the virus that causes COVID-19. There are a few reports of patients with COVID-19 who received these drugs and improved. Some are reports of groups of patients, all of whom received the drug. It is not known whether it was the drug that led to the improvement or whether there were other factors involved. We do not know if the treated patients’ condition would have improved without the drug. To know this, there would have to be a group of similar patients who did not receive the drug (control). Because chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine may possibly help very sick patients, FDA is allowing these drugs to be provided to certain hospitalized patients under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) issued March 28, 2020.  Under the EUA, health care providers and patients are provided with information about the risks of these drugs. However, more data from clinical trials are necessary for us to determine whether chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate are safe and effective in treating or preventing COVID-19.	episode_done:True
text: Does covid 19 spread in warm weather?	labels: COVID-19 is contagious and it is actively spreading from person to person.

text: Do I have to wear a mask all the time if I am not infected?	labels: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others. If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time.

For severe illness, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.  Currently there are no FDA-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of COVID-19. Researchers are studying new drugs, and drugs that are already approved for other health conditions, as possible treatments for COVID-19. The FDA is working with drug manufacturers, researchers, and other partners to accelerate the development process for COVID-19 treatments. CDC has more information for health care providers about these potential treatments. Never take a prescription medicine or drug if it is not prescribed for you by your doctor for your health condition.	episode_done:True
text: What are the ways to prevent coronavirus?	labels: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others. If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time. That is because there are not enough of these masks for health care workers. Health care workers need these masks to stay safe and to take care of sick patients. If you have extra surgical or N95 masks, please donate them to your local healthcare facility.	episode_done:True

text: What are the ways to prevent coronavirus?	labels: Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. There are different types of coronaviruses.Some types of coronavirus are more common in people and some versions are more common in animals. Rarely, a type of the virus that was common in animals can spread to people. "Coronavirus Disease 2019” (which is shortened to "COVID-19") is an example of a type of coronavirus that has recently spread to humans.	episode_done:True

text: Once you are cured from Covid 19 can you catch it again?	labels: ​Currently, there is no evidence that COVID-19 can spread through contact with imported goods. There have been no cases of COVID-19 in the United States associated with imported goods. Other coronaviruses do not survive well on surfaces. So, experts think the risk of spread from products or packages shipped over days or weeks is extremely low. Coronaviruses spread most often by small droplets of mucus from the nose and throat.	episode_done:True
text: Once you are cured from Covid 19 can you catch it again?	labels: You can protect your child by having them wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and avoid people who are sick. They should also stay away from people outside your home. This means you should avoid playdates, playing on public playgrounds, or being physically close to friends.You should also clean and disinfect surfaces that you touch a lot in household common areas like tables, chairs, and doorknobs. Wash clothes and plush toys frequently.	episode_done:True
text: Once you are cured from Covid 19 can you catch it again?	labels: COVID-19 is a virus strain, first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, that has only spread in people since December 2019. Health experts are closely monitoring the situation because little is known about this new virus and it has the potential to cause severe illness and pneumonia in some people.	episode_done:True
text: Once you are cured from Covid 19 can you catch it again?	labels: Right now, we don't know of any clear cases of the virus passing from people to their pets. There was a tiger in a zoo in New York City that seems to have gotten COVID-19 from its caretakers. To be safe, wash your hands before and after touching animals. Until we know more, if you have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and have a pet or other animal, you should:1. Avoid close contact with them. Do not snuggle or kiss them, let them lick you, sit on your lap, or sleep in your bed. 2. Avoid coughing and sneezing on your animals. Cover your coughs and sneezes. 3. Have another member of your household care for your animals, if you can. 4. If it's not possible to have someone else care for your animal, always wash your hands before touching or feeding them. 5. Limit your animal's contact with other people and animals. Tthis may mean keeping them indoors.We might learn more about human to animal spread in the future.

text: Will social distancing slow the spread of covid 19?	labels: Together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19 by making a conscious effort to keep a physical distance between each other. Physical (social) distancing is proven to be one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of illness during an outbreak. This means making changes in your everyday routines to minimize close contact with others, including:avoiding crowded places and non-essential gatherings avoiding common greetings, such as handshakes limiting contact with people at higher risk like older adults and those in poor health keeping a distance of at least 2 arms-length (approximately 2 metres) from others	episode_done:True

text: Will social distancing slow the spread of covid 19?	labels: COVID-19 is contagious and it is actively spreading from person to person. The CDC recommends that those who have COVID-19 are isolated either at a hospital or at home, depending on how sick they are, until they are no longer at risk of infecting others.	episode_done:True
text: Will social distancing slow the spread of covid 19?	labels: Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease. Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure. For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days. Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period.	episode_done:True

text: How long can the virus stay in the air?	labels: Staying at home and using "social distancing" helps stop the virus from spreading quickly. This helps to reduce the burden on healthcare systems, as there are not enough hospital workers and beds if too many people get sick at once.Social distancing means staying farther away from other people and avoiding groups of people. Since COVID-19 mostly spreads from person-to-person interactions, staying at least 6 feet away from other people can help stop the spread. It is important to use social distancing because people can spread COVID-19 even if they feel fine. It is especially important to use social distancing to protect people who are more likely to get very sick from the disease.	episode_done:True

On copper, it can live up to four hours. It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID-19 from these surfaces.  It is still important to regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces as well as packages and mail that come through. Remember to wash your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol based hand sanitizer (60%).	episode_done:True

It can also spead if you touch something that an infected person has touched, like a door knob, elevator button, or bathroom faucet.That's why it's important to wash your hands, avoid touching your face, and practice social distancing to avoid getting sick. That's why it's also important to self-isolate and wear a mask around other household members if you are sick to avoid infecting other people.	episode_done:True
text: How to stay safe?	labels: How long you should be isolated for varies on a case-by-case basis. If you have been sick with COVID-19 and have been in isolation, you should talk to your healthcare provider to decide when you can be released from isolation. Your doctor will look for signs that:-You are fever-free without taking fever-reducing medication -You no longer show symptoms -Sometimes, your doctor might recommend testing respiratory samples to decide if you can be released from isolationOnce you have been released from isolation, then you are no longer considered to be likely to infect other people.	episode_done:True
text: Which are its first symptoms?	labels: Those who are infected with COVID-19 may have little to no symptoms. You may not know you have symptoms of COVID-19 because they are similar to a cold or flu. Symptoms haveincluded:cough fever difficulty breathing pneumonia in both lungsIn severe cases, infection can leadto death.Symptoms may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to COVID-19. This is the longest known incubation period for this disease.Recent evidence indicates that the virus can be transmitted to othersfrom someone who is infected but not showing symptoms. This includes peoplewho:have not yet developed symptoms (pre-symptomatic) never develop symptoms (asymptomatic)While experts know that these kinds of transmissions are happening amongthose in close contact or in close physical settings, it is not known to whatextent. This means it is extremely important to follow the proven preventative measures.Think you might have COVID-19? Take a self-assessment	episode_done:True
text: Which are its first symptoms?	labels: Children and adults have the same COVID-19 symptoms, although children might not get as sick as adults. Children might get a fever, runny nose, or cough. Some children have had vomiting or diarrhea. We are still learning about how COVID-19 affects children.	episode_done:True
text: Which are its first symptoms?	labels: People might be able to spread the disease before people realize they are sick. But most scientists think that people are most likely to infect others when they have symptoms and feel sick.

text: Which are its first symptoms?	labels: The time between exposure to the COVID-19 virus and onset of symptoms is called the “incubation period.” The incubation period for COVID-19 is typically 2 to 14 days, although in some cases it may be longer.	episode_done:True
text: How long does the virus survive on a surface?	labels: Current thinking is that COVID-19 mostly spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets. But some studies show that the virus can last on surfaces, so it is possible that someone could get the virus by touching a surface that has the virus on it and then touching their mouth, nose, or eyes.	episode_done:True
text: How long does the virus survive on a surface?	labels: A recent study shows that the virus can live in the air and on surfaces from several hours to several days. On plastic, it can live for up to 72 hours (3 days). On stainless steel, it can live for up to 48 hours (2 days). On cardboard, it can live up to 24 hours (1 day). On copper, it can live up to four hours. It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID-19 from these surfaces.  It is still important to regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces as well as packages and mail that come through. Remember to wash your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol based hand sanitizer (60%).	episode_done:True

text: What is COVID-19?	labels: Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. There are different types of coronaviruses.Some types of coronavirus are more common in people and some versions are more common in animals. Rarely, a type of the virus that was common in animals can spread to people. "Coronavirus Disease 2019” (which is shortened to "COVID-19") is an example of a type of coronavirus that has recently spread to humans.	episode_done:True
text: When should I contact a doctor?	labels: If you are having symptoms of COVID-19, call your health care provider to be tested. If you do not have a health care provider, call 2-1-1 to be connected with a local community or hospital-connected clinic for referral to a test site. Health care providers are encouraged to order a test for any child or adult who is showing symptoms of COVID-19, even if their symptoms are mild.	episode_done:True
text: When should I contact a doctor?	labels: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others. If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time. That is because there are not enough of these masks for health care workers. Health care workers need these masks to stay safe and to take care of sick patients. If you have extra surgical or N95 masks, please donate them to your local healthcare facility.	episode_done:True
text: When should I contact a doctor?	labels: If you do not have any symptoms, you will be asked to:1. Self-quarantine for 14 days after you get home.2. Do not have any visitors, especially older adults, or those with health problems who are higher risk of severe illness. 3. Monitor your health for fever, cough, or trouble breathing. 4. Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use an alcohol based hand sanitizer that is at least 60% alcohol. 5.

text: Does a mask actually help if I m not sick?	labels: Fewer children seem to get infected by the coronavirus than adults, and most of those who do contract it have mild symptoms, if any.A very small number of children with the virus have shown symptoms associated with toxic shock or Kawasaki disease. This is a rare illness in children, according to the New York City Health Department, that involves inflammation of the blood vessels, including coronary arteries. Two studies conducted in recent weeks offer compelling evidence that children can transmit the virus.

text: Does a mask actually help if I m not sick?	labels: Most people who get COVID-19 will be able to recover at home. If possible, have the sick household member use a separate room and bathroom. Try to have the sick family member stay away from other people as much as they can. Clean and sanitize your hands and home regularly.Don't share personal items like utensils, foods, and drinks.The sick person should stay at home except to get medical care. Please contact a health care provider right away if they have one of these severe symptoms: -Trouble breathing-Shortness of breath-Chest pain or pressure that won't go away -Feeling very tired or unable to wake up from sleeping -Lips or face look bluePlease keep in mind that this is not the full list. If someone in your house has one of these severe symptoms or something that worries you, please contact your medical provider.	episode_done:True
text: What is the difference between a bacteria and a virus?	labels: You need to self-isolate if you have been confirmed to have COVID-19. Isolation is a health care term that means keeping infected people away from those who are not infected. If you have been asked to self-isolate, you should:-Stay at home except to get medical care -Stay away from other people in your home as much as you can -Wear a face mask if you need to be around other people (for example, in a doctor's office) -Cover your coughs and sneezes -Wash your hands frequently -Continue to monitor your symptoms until your doctor says you don't need to be in isolation any moreQuarantine means staying away from other people because you might have been exposed to the virus. For COVID-19, people should quarantine for at least 14 days, or 2 weeks from the time they might have had contact with someone with COVID-19. That's because most people who get COVID-19 would have symptoms within 14 days. Scientists think that people are not likely to spread COVID-19 to others if they do not get sick after 14 days.	episode_done:True

text: What is the difference between a bacteria and a virus?	labels: The difference between self-monitoring and self-isolation is based on whether you have been diagnosed with COVID-19 or not. If you may have been exposed to COVID-19 but don't have symptoms, you should self-monitor. If you have been diagnosed with COVID-19, you should self-isolate.You need to self-monitor if you have no symptoms but may have been exposed to COVID-19 in the last 14 days or are in close contact with older adults, people who are medically vulnerable or have been asked to do so by your Public Health Authority. Self-monitoring means you should:-Monitor yourself for 14 days for symptoms like fever, cough, and trouble breathing -Stay at home -Avoid crowded places -Stay at least 6 feet away from others as much as you can -Wash your hands frequentlyYou need to self-isolate if you have been confirmed to have COVID-19. Isolation means keeping infected people away from those who are not infected.

text: How did it started?	labels: COVID-19 can spread in a few different ways. It can spread from person to person if you inhale an infected person's respiratory droplets when they sneezes, coughs, or talk. It can also spead if you touch something that an infected person has touched, like a door knob, elevator button, or bathroom faucet.That's why it's important to wash your hands, avoid touching your face, and practice social distancing to avoid getting sick. That's why it's also important to self-isolate and wear a mask around other household members if you are sick to avoid infecting other people.	episode_done:True
text: How did it started?	labels: How long you should be isolated for varies on a case-by-case basis. If you have been sick with COVID-19 and have been in isolation, you should talk to your healthcare provider to decide when you can be released from isolation. Your doctor will look for signs that:-You are fever-free without taking fever-reducing medication -You no longer show symptoms -Sometimes, your doctor might recommend testing respiratory samples to decide if you can be released from isolationOnce you have been released from isolation, then you are no longer considered to be likely to infect other people.	episode_done:True
text: How did it started?	labels: Try to avoid all unnecessary travel at this time. If it is essential to travel, try to avoid contact with sick passengers, mantain as much distance as possible from other passengers, avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth with unwashed hands, and wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds or use hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. You should also wear a cloth face covering while at the airport and on the plane.	episode_done:True
text: Do we need to wear a mask?	labels: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others. If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time. That is because there are not enough of these masks for health care workers. Health care workers need these masks to stay safe and to take care of sick patients. If you have extra surgical or N95 masks, please donate them to your local healthcare facility.	episode_done:True
text: Do we need to wear a mask?	labels: Children under the age of 2 years should not wear any type of masks. Because babies' airways are smaller, breathing through a mask is even harder on them and they are more likely to suffocate if they use a mask. Older infants or young toddlers are not likely to keep the mask on and will likely try to remove it. This will mean they are touching their face more and could infect themselves with the virus. It is safest to keep children at home and follow social distancing.	episode_done:True
text: Do we need to wear a mask?	labels: CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public when other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission of the coronavirus. The purpose of wearing cloth face coverings in public is to slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others. Read more about types of face masks and FDA’s emergency use authorization for non-surgical face masks.	episode_done:True

text: How long will the pandemic last?	labels: A recent study shows that the virus can live in the air and on surfaces from several hours to several days. On plastic, it can live for up to 72 hours (3 days). On stainless steel, it can live for up to 48 hours (2 days). On cardboard, it can live up to 24 hours (1 day). On copper, it can live up to four hours. It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID-19 from these surfaces.  It is still important to regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces as well as packages and mail that come through. Remember to wash your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol based hand sanitizer (60%).	episode_done:True
text: How long will the pandemic last?	labels: Quarantine means staying away from other people because you might have been exposed to the virus.

text: Can my dog get COVID 19 and transmit it to other people?	labels: Preliminary findings from limited laboratory experimental studies indicate that, of species tested thus far, cats are the species most susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2. Some cats in these studies developed signs of clinical disease. Ferrets were also found to be susceptible to infection, but appeared less likely to develop disease. In the laboratory setting cats and ferrets were also able to transmit SARS-CoV-2 to other cats and ferrets, respectively. Golden Syrian hamsters were also able to be experimentally infected and were able to spread the infection to other hamsters. Dogs appeared to be susceptible to infection, but less so than cats or ferrets. Other preliminary laboratory findings indicate that poultry and pigs are not susceptible to infection with SARS-CoV-2.It is important to understand that experimentally induced infection does not mirror naturally induced infection. In other words, just because an animal can be experimentally infected via inoculation with high concentrations of purified tissue-cultured virus does not mean that it will be easily be infected with that same virus under natural conditions. The number of animals involved in these studies was also very small and conclusions were drawn based on data that, in some cases, were collected from as few as two animals. There is no evidence to suggest that animals, including pets, that may be incidentally infected by humans are playing a role in the spread of COVID-19. Human outbreaks are driven by person-to-person transmission.	episode_done:True
text: Can my dog get COVID 19 and transmit it to other people?	labels: Right now, we don't know of any clear cases of the virus passing from people to their pets. There was a tiger in a zoo in New York City that seems to have gotten COVID-19 from its caretakers. To be safe, wash your hands before and after touching animals. Until we know more, if you have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and have a pet or other animal, you should:1. Avoid close contact with them. Do not snuggle or kiss them, let them lick you, sit on your lap, or sleep in your bed. 2. Avoid coughing and sneezing on your animals. Cover your coughs and sneezes. 3. Have another member of your household care for your animals, if you can. 4. If it's not possible to have someone else care for your animal, always wash your hands before touching or feeding them. 5. Limit your animal's contact with other people and animals. Tthis may mean keeping them indoors.We might learn more about human to animal spread in the future. Talk to your pet's doctor if you are worried about your pet's health.	episode_done:True
text: Can my dog get COVID 19 and transmit it to other people?	labels: Right now, COVID-19 mostly spreads from person to person. But experts agree that the virus likely came from bats and may have passed through another type of animal in China before spreading to people. If you are going to travel, check the latest health notices for up-to-date advice before you leave. Avoid contact with animals, including wild meat and live animal markets.Animal importers, rescues, and adoptive families should limit or postpone importing animals from affected areas. If animals are imported from an affected area, monitor them closely for illness. Call a veterinarian if they get sick and call before bringing them to the office so that they can prepare.	episode_done:True
text: Can my dog get COVID 19 and transmit it to other people?	labels: If you are having symptoms of COVID-19, call your health care provider for a referral. If you do not have a health care provider, call 2-1-1 to be connected with a local community or hospital-connected clinic for a referral to a test site. If you are having a medical emergency, call 9-1-1 or go to the hospital. Health care providers are encouraged to order a test for any child or adult who is showing symptoms of COVID-19, even if their symptoms are mild. Find out what to do if you are sick from the CDC and what to do while youâre waiting for test results. Pop-up Testing Sites Any Vermonter without symptoms can be tested at a pop-up testing site without a doctorâs referral. This includes people who work in Vermont, second homeowners, and college students. Registration for testing is required. For people who do not have internet access and want to register at a pop-up site, they can call 2-1-1 for help with registration. Register for a pop-up testing site. The test is a nasopharyngeal swab, or NP swab, where a health care professional uses a swab to collect a sample from the back of the nose and throat. This test will tell you if you have a current infection. It is not a serology/antibody test, which means it will not tell you if you were infected in the past. The following groups are encouraged to get tested at pop-up sites: health care workers, first responders (EMS, fire, and law enforcement), child care providers currently serving essential workers, and anyone currently under quarantine who has had no symptoms during the first seven days of quarantine.

For severe illness, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.  Currently there are no FDA-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of COVID-19. Researchers are studying new drugs, and drugs that are already approved for other health conditions, as possible treatments for COVID-19. The FDA is working with drug manufacturers, researchers, and other partners to accelerate the development process for COVID-19 treatments.

Travellers who develop any symptoms during or after travel should self-isolate; those developing acute respiratory symptoms within 14 days upon return should be advised to seek immediate medical advice, ideally by phone first to their national healthcare provider.	episode_done:True
text: What is the current situation?	labels: Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. There are different types of coronaviruses.Some types of coronavirus are more common in people and some versions are more common in animals. Rarely, a type of the virus that was common in animals can spread to people. "Coronavirus Disease 2019” (which is shortened to "COVID-19") is an example of a type of coronavirus that has recently spread to humans.	episode_done:True
text: What is the current situation?	labels: COVID-19 is a disease caused by a new type of virus. Sometimes people also call it "coronavirus," which is is the type of virus that causes COVID-19. COVID-19 causes some symptoms that are like getting a cold or flu. But some people get worse symptoms and need more care. COVID-19 is caused by a new type of virus that our body has not seen before. Since our body has not seen it before, our immune system has to learn how to fight off this new virus.	episode_done:True
text: What is the current situation?	labels: MERS-CoV is one type of coronavirus. It is different type from the type of coronavirus that causes COVID-19. MERS-CoV stands for "Middle East Respiratory Syndrome- associated Coronavirus."The first cases of MERS-CoV were seen in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. MERS-CoV symptoms are fever, cough, and shortness of breath. People with this disease usually do not get sick from one another unless they are in very close contact.	episode_done:True
text: How long do I have stay in isolation?	labels: Staying at home and using "social distancing" helps stop the virus from spreading quickly. This helps to reduce the burden on healthcare systems, as there are not enough hospital workers and beds if too many people get sick at once.Social distancing means staying farther away from other people and avoiding groups of people. Since COVID-19 mostly spreads from person-to-person interactions, staying at least 6 feet away from other people can help stop the spread. It is important to use social distancing because people can spread COVID-19 even if they feel fine. It is especially important to use social distancing to protect people who are more likely to get very sick from the disease.	episode_done:True
text: How long do I have stay in isolation?	labels: How long you should be isolated for varies on a case-by-case basis. If you have been sick with COVID-19 and have been in isolation, you should talk to your healthcare provider to decide when you can be released from isolation. Your doctor will look for signs that:-You are fever-free without taking fever-reducing medication -You no longer show symptoms -Sometimes, your doctor might recommend testing respiratory samples to decide if you can be released from isolationOnce you have been released from isolation, then you are no longer considered to be likely to infect other people.	episode_done:True
text: How long do I have stay in isolation?	labels: Social distancing helps to reduce the chance of infecting people who are more likely to get severe disease. It helps to stop the virus from spreading quickly. This also helps to prevent there being too many sick people for hospitals to handle.	episode_done:True
text: How long do I have stay in isolation?	labels: You need to self-isolate if you have been confirmed to have COVID-19. Isolation is a health care term that means keeping infected people away from those who are not infected. If you have been asked to self-isolate, you should:-Stay at home except to get medical care -Stay away from other people in your home as much as you can -Wear a face mask if you need to be around other people (for example, in a doctor's office) -Cover your coughs and sneezes -Wash your hands frequently -Continue to monitor your symptoms until your doctor says you don't need to be in isolation any moreQuarantine means staying away from other people because you might have been exposed to the virus. For COVID-19, people should quarantine for at least 14 days, or 2 weeks from the time they might have had contact with someone with COVID-19. That's because most people who get COVID-19 would have symptoms within 14 days. Scientists think that people are not likely to spread COVID-19 to others if they do not get sick after 14 days.	episode_done:True
text: How long do I have stay in isolation?	labels: It is a challenging time with schools, daycares and unversities being closed. Talk to the  school or facility  about their emergency operations plan. Understand the plan for continuing education and social services (such as student meal programs) during school dismissals. If your child attends a  college or university , encourage them to learn about the school’s plan for a COVID-19 outbreak.	episode_done:True
text: What is the best way to protect yourself from Covid 19?	labels: You can protect your child by having them wash hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds and avoid people who are sick. They should also stay away from people outside your home. This means you should avoid playdates, playing on public playgrounds, or being physically close to friends.You should also clean and disinfect surfaces that you touch a lot in household common areas like tables, chairs, and doorknobs. Wash clothes and plush toys frequently.	episode_done:True
text: What is the best way to protect yourself from Covid 19?	labels: CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public when other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission of the coronavirus.

If your surfaces are dirty, clean them using detergent or soap and water prior to disinfection.	episode_done:True
text: What is the best way to protect yourself from Covid 19?	labels: COVID-19 is a virus strain, first identified in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, that has only spread in people since December 2019. Health experts are closely monitoring the situation because little is known about this new virus and it has the potential to cause severe illness and pneumonia in some people.	episode_done:True
text: How long does COVID 19 live on glass surfaces?	labels: A recent study shows that the virus can live in the air and on surfaces from several hours to several days. On plastic, it can live for up to 72 hours (3 days). On stainless steel, it can live for up to 48 hours (2 days). On cardboard, it can live up to 24 hours (1 day). On copper, it can live up to four hours. It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID-19 from these surfaces.  It is still important to regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces as well as packages and mail that come through. Remember to wash your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol based hand sanitizer (60%).	episode_done:True
text: How long does COVID 19 live on glass surfaces?	labels: COVID-19 can spread in a few different ways. It can spread from person to person if you inhale an infected person's respiratory droplets when they sneezes, coughs, or talk. It can also spead if you touch something that an infected person has touched, like a door knob, elevator button, or bathroom faucet.That's why it's important to wash your hands, avoid touching your face, and practice social distancing to avoid getting sick. That's why it's also important to self-isolate and wear a mask around other household members if you are sick to avoid infecting other people.	episode_done:True
text: How long does COVID 19 live on glass surfaces?	labels: In the lab, these drugs have been shown to prevent the growth of the virus that causes COVID-19. There are a few reports of patients with COVID-19 who received these drugs and improved. Some are reports of groups of patients, all of whom received the drug. It is not known whether it was the drug that led to the improvement or whether there were other factors involved. We do not know if the treated patients’ condition would have improved without the drug. To know this, there would have to be a group of similar patients who did not receive the drug (control). Because chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine may possibly help very sick patients, FDA is allowing these drugs to be provided to certain hospitalized patients under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) issued March 28, 2020.  Under the EUA, health care providers and patients are provided with information about the risks of these drugs. However, more data from clinical trials are necessary for us to determine whether chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate are safe and effective in treating or preventing COVID-19.	episode_done:True
text: How long does COVID 19 live on glass surfaces?	labels: Together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19 by making a conscious effort to keep a physical distance between each other. Physical (social) distancing is proven to be one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of illness during an outbreak. This means making changes in your everyday routines to minimize close contact with others, including:avoiding crowded places and non-essential gatherings avoiding common greetings, such as handshakes limiting contact with people at higher risk like older adults and those in poor health keeping a distance of at least 2 arms-length (approximately 2 metres) from others	episode_done:True

text: What are the symptoms of covid 19?	labels: People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. People with mild symptoms are able to recover at home. If you experience a medical emergency such as trouble breathing, call 911 and let the operator know you may have COVID-19. For severe illness, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.  Currently there are no FDA-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of COVID-19. Researchers are studying new drugs, and drugs that are already approved for other health conditions, as possible treatments for COVID-19. The FDA is working with drug manufacturers, researchers, and other partners to accelerate the development process for COVID-19 treatments. CDC has more information for health care providers about these potential treatments. Never take a prescription medicine or drug if it is not prescribed for you by your doctor for your health condition.	episode_done:True
text: Why does the government think that we don t need to wear face masks when clearly citizens from countries that are able to contain the virus are all wearing face masks regardless if they are sick or not?	labels: Children under the age of 2 years should not wear any type of masks. Because babies' airways are smaller, breathing through a mask is even harder on them and they are more likely to suffocate if they use a mask. Older infants or young toddlers are not likely to keep the mask on and will likely try to remove it. This will mean they are touching their face more and could infect themselves with the virus. It is safest to keep children at home and follow social distancing.	episode_done:True

text: If you contract COVID 19 how do you treat yourself at home?	labels: Staying at home and using "social distancing" helps stop the virus from spreading quickly. This helps to reduce the burden on healthcare systems, as there are not enough hospital workers and beds if too many people get sick at once.Social distancing means staying farther away from other people and avoiding groups of people. Since COVID-19 mostly spreads from person-to-person interactions, staying at least 6 feet away from other people can help stop the spread. It is important to use social distancing because people can spread COVID-19 even if they feel fine. It is especially important to use social distancing to protect people who are more likely to get very sick from the disease.	episode_done:True
text: Does my neighbour have covid 19 symptoms?	labels: Those who are infected with COVID-19 may have little to no symptoms. You may not know you have symptoms of COVID-19 because they are similar to a cold or flu. Symptoms haveincluded:cough fever difficulty breathing pneumonia in both lungsIn severe cases, infection can leadto death.Symptoms may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to COVID-19. This is the longest known incubation period for this disease.Recent evidence indicates that the virus can be transmitted to othersfrom someone who is infected but not showing symptoms. This includes peoplewho:have not yet developed symptoms (pre-symptomatic) never develop symptoms (asymptomatic)While experts know that these kinds of transmissions are happening amongthose in close contact or in close physical settings, it is not known to whatextent.

text: Does my neighbour have covid 19 symptoms?	labels: COVID-19 can spread in a few different ways. It can spread from person to person if you inhale an infected person's respiratory droplets when they sneezes, coughs, or talk. It can also spead if you touch something that an infected person has touched, like a door knob, elevator button, or bathroom faucet.That's why it's important to wash your hands, avoid touching your face, and practice social distancing to avoid getting sick. That's why it's also important to self-isolate and wear a mask around other household members if you are sick to avoid infecting other people.	episode_done:True
text: Does my neighbour have covid 19 symptoms?	labels: In the lab, these drugs have been shown to prevent the growth of the virus that causes COVID-19. There are a few reports of patients with COVID-19 who received these drugs and improved. Some are reports of groups of patients, all of whom received the drug. It is not known whether it was the drug that led to the improvement or whether there were other factors involved. We do not know if the treated patients’ condition would have improved without the drug. To know this, there would have to be a group of similar patients who did not receive the drug (control). Because chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine may possibly help very sick patients, FDA is allowing these drugs to be provided to certain hospitalized patients under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) issued March 28, 2020.  Under the EUA, health care providers and patients are provided with information about the risks of these drugs. However, more data from clinical trials are necessary for us to determine whether chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate are safe and effective in treating or preventing COVID-19.	episode_done:True
text: Does my neighbour have covid 19 symptoms?	labels: Fewer children seem to get infected by the coronavirus than adults, and most of those who do contract it have mild symptoms, if any.A very small number of children with the virus have shown symptoms associated with toxic shock or Kawasaki disease. This is a rare illness in children, according to the New York City Health Department, that involves inflammation of the blood vessels, including coronary arteries. Two studies conducted in recent weeks offer compelling evidence that children can transmit the virus. While neither proved it, many epidemiologists who were not involved in the research said that the evidence was strong enough to suggest that schools should be kept closed for now.

text: What are the symptoms of COVID 19?	labels: SARS-COV-2 is the name for the virus that causes the disease known as "COVID-19." Let's break it down."SARS" stands for "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome", meaning that it can cause serious problems with breathing and the lungs."COV" stands for "Coronavirus." This is the type of virus that causes COVID-19. The "2" is a way to say that this virus is different than the SARS virus that caused an outbreak in 2002-2003.	episode_done:True
text: What are the symptoms of COVID 19?	labels: People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. People with mild symptoms are able to recover at home. If you experience a medical emergency such as trouble breathing, call 911 and let the operator know you may have COVID-19. For severe illness, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.  Currently there are no FDA-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of COVID-19. Researchers are studying new drugs, and drugs that are already approved for other health conditions, as possible treatments for COVID-19. The FDA is working with drug manufacturers, researchers, and other partners to accelerate the development process for COVID-19 treatments. CDC has more information for health care providers about these potential treatments. Never take a prescription medicine or drug if it is not prescribed for you by your doctor for your health condition.	episode_done:True
text: Should I wear a mask?	labels: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others. If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time. That is because there are not enough of these masks for health care workers. Health care workers need these masks to stay safe and to take care of sick patients. If you have extra surgical or N95 masks, please donate them to your local healthcare facility.	episode_done:True
text: Should I wear a mask?	labels: Children under the age of 2 years should not wear any type of masks. Because babies' airways are smaller, breathing through a mask is even harder on them and they are more likely to suffocate if they use a mask. Older infants or young toddlers are not likely to keep the mask on and will likely try to remove it. This will mean they are touching their face more and could infect themselves with the virus. It is safest to keep children at home and follow social distancing.	episode_done:True

text: Should I wear a mask?	labels: CDC recommends wearing cloth face coverings in public when other social distancing measures are difficult to maintain (e.g., grocery stores and pharmacies) especially in areas of significant community-based transmission of the coronavirus. The purpose of wearing cloth face coverings in public is to slow the spread of the virus and help people who may have the virus and do not know it from transmitting it to others. Read more about types of face masks and FDA’s emergency use authorization for non-surgical face masks.	episode_done:True
text: Should I wear a mask?	labels: If you are having symptoms of COVID-19, call your health care provider to be tested. If you do not have a health care provider, call 2-1-1 to be connected with a local community or hospital-connected clinic for referral to a test site. Health care providers are encouraged to order a test for any child or adult who is showing symptoms of COVID-19, even if their symptoms are mild.	episode_done:True
text: How long before the symptoms to coronavirus appear?	labels: Quarantine means staying away from other people because you might have been exposed to the virus. For COVID-19, people should quarantine for at least 14 days, or 2 weeks from the time they might have had contact with someone with COVID-19. That's because most people who get COVID-19 would have symptoms within 14 days. Scientists think that people are not likely to spread COVID-19 to others if they do not get sick after 14 days. Remember, every time you could have been exposed to the virus means you should restart your 14 day clock for quarantine.	episode_done:True

Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time. That is because there are not enough of these masks for health care workers. Health care workers need these masks to stay safe and to take care of sick patients. If you have extra surgical or N95 masks, please donate them to your local healthcare facility.	episode_done:True
text: How does the virus spread?	labels: Current thinking is that COVID-19 mostly spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets. But some studies show that the virus can last on surfaces, so it is possible that someone could get the virus by touching a surface that has the virus on it and then touching their mouth, nose, or eyes.	episode_done:True
text: Is missing the smelling one of the symptoms?	labels: The time between exposure to the COVID-19 virus and onset of symptoms is called the “incubation period.” The incubation period for COVID-19 is typically 2 to 14 days, although in some cases it may be longer.	episode_done:True
text: Is missing the smelling one of the symptoms?	labels: Those who are infected with COVID-19 may have little to no symptoms. You may not know you have symptoms of COVID-19 because they are similar to a cold or flu. Symptoms haveincluded:cough fever difficulty breathing pneumonia in both lungsIn severe cases, infection can leadto death.Symptoms may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to COVID-19. This is the longest known incubation period for this disease.Recent evidence indicates that the virus can be transmitted to othersfrom someone who is infected but not showing symptoms. This includes peoplewho:have not yet developed symptoms (pre-symptomatic) never develop symptoms (asymptomatic)While experts know that these kinds of transmissions are happening amongthose in close contact or in close physical settings, it is not known to whatextent.

text: How many cases?	labels: COVID-19 can spread in a few different ways. It can spread from person to person if you inhale an infected person's respiratory droplets when they sneezes, coughs, or talk. It can also spead if you touch something that an infected person has touched, like a door knob, elevator button, or bathroom faucet.That's why it's important to wash your hands, avoid touching your face, and practice social distancing to avoid getting sick. That's why it's also important to self-isolate and wear a mask around other household members if you are sick to avoid infecting other people.	episode_done:True
text: How many cases?	labels: How long you should be isolated for varies on a case-by-case basis. If you have been sick with COVID-19 and have been in isolation, you should talk to your healthcare provider to decide when you can be released from isolation. Your doctor will look for signs that:-You are fever-free without taking fever-reducing medication -You no longer show symptoms -Sometimes, your doctor might recommend testing respiratory samples to decide if you can be released from isolationOnce you have been released from isolation, then you are no longer considered to be likely to infect other people.	episode_done:True
text: Whom should I consult if I feel I am affected?	labels: The risk of COVID-19 spreading from products or packaging shipped over a period of days or weeks is likely to be low. Currently, there is no evidence that COVID-19 has been spread from imported goods.	episode_done:True
text: Whom should I consult if I feel I am affected?	labels: Because COVID-19 is a new disease, we are still learning how it affects pregnant women. At this time, there is no evidence to suggest that pregnant women are at a greater risk for more serious outcomes related to COVID-19 or that their developing child could be negatively affected by COVID-19. You can protect yourself from becoming ill by taking the following precautions:stay home as much as possible, except for important medical appointments talk to your doctor, obstetrician or midwife about the possibility of telephone or videoconference appointments avoid unnecessary visitors to your home wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds use alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available practise physical distancing by keeping a distance of at least 2 metres from others avoid touching your mouth, nose and eyes avoid crowded places and peak-hours make limited trips to the store for essentials avoid travel by public transitFor more information, refer to our advice for motherson pregnancy, childbirth and caring for newborns. If you are pregnant and concerned about COVID-19, speak to your health care provider.	episode_done:True
text: Whom should I consult if I feel I am affected?	labels: If you do not have any symptoms, you will be asked to:1. Self-quarantine for 14 days after you get home.2. Do not have any visitors, especially older adults, or those with health problems who are higher risk of severe illness. 3. Monitor your health for fever, cough, or trouble breathing. 4. Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use an alcohol based hand sanitizer that is at least 60% alcohol. 5. Cover your mouth and nose with your arm or a tissue when coughing or sneezing. Throw away the tissue right after and wash your hands. If you start to have symptoms like a cough or fever within the 14 days:1. Continue to self-isolate from others.2. Call a healthcare professional or a public health authority and tell them your symptoms and travel history. Follow their instructions.3.If your symptoms are severe - such as pain or pressure in the chest that won't go away, trouble breathing, feeling confused or unable to arouse, or lips or face that look blue, seek medical care right away. Please contact your medical provider if you have questions about your health and safety.	episode_done:True
text: Whom should I consult if I feel I am affected?	labels: If you are having symptoms of COVID-19, call your health care provider to be tested. If you do not have a health care provider, call 2-1-1 to be connected with a local community or hospital-connected clinic for referral to a test site. Health care providers are encouraged to order a test for any child or adult who is showing symptoms of COVID-19, even if their symptoms are mild.	episode_done:True
text: Whom should I consult if I feel I am affected?	labels: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others. If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth.

text: How long can COVID-19 live in surfaces?	labels: A recent study shows that the virus can live in the air and on surfaces from several hours to several days. On plastic, it can live for up to 72 hours (3 days). On stainless steel, it can live for up to 48 hours (2 days). On cardboard, it can live up to 24 hours (1 day). On copper, it can live up to four hours. It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID-19 from these surfaces.  It is still important to regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces as well as packages and mail that come through. Remember to wash your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol based hand sanitizer (60%).	episode_done:True

text: What are the minor symptoms that may not seem as though it is COVID 19 but in fact are?	labels: People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. People with mild symptoms are able to recover at home. If you experience a medical emergency such as trouble breathing, call 911 and let the operator know you may have COVID-19. For severe illness, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.  Currently there are no FDA-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of COVID-19. Researchers are studying new drugs, and drugs that are already approved for other health conditions, as possible treatments for COVID-19. The FDA is working with drug manufacturers, researchers, and other partners to accelerate the development process for COVID-19 treatments.

text: How do you differentiate between Covid 19 and the flu?	labels: You need to self-isolate if you have been confirmed to have COVID-19. Isolation is a health care term that means keeping infected people away from those who are not infected. If you have been asked to self-isolate, you should:-Stay at home except to get medical care -Stay away from other people in your home as much as you can -Wear a face mask if you need to be around other people (for example, in a doctor's office) -Cover your coughs and sneezes -Wash your hands frequently -Continue to monitor your symptoms until your doctor says you don't need to be in isolation any moreQuarantine means staying away from other people because you might have been exposed to the virus. For COVID-19, people should quarantine for at least 14 days, or 2 weeks from the time they might have had contact with someone with COVID-19. That's because most people who get COVID-19 would have symptoms within 14 days. Scientists think that people are not likely to spread COVID-19 to others if they do not get sick after 14 days.	episode_done:True
text: How likely am I to catch COVID 19?	labels: Pregnant women should do the same things as everyone else to avoid COVID-19 infection, including: Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, you can use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Clean and disinfect frequently-touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash and wash your hands. Stay home when you are sick. When you must go out, practice social distancing.	episode_done:True

text: How likely am I to catch COVID 19?	labels: Generally, do not touch the body of someone who has died of COVID-19. We are still learning how COVID-19 spreads and if a deceased body can transmit the virus. One could get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it, and then touching their face (like their mouth, nose, or eyes). Try to avoid kissing washing, and shrouding the body. If washing and shrouding the body are important in your culture or religion, work with your community cultural and religious leaders as well as funeral home staff to try to reduce exposure as much as possible. People who conduct these activities should wear disposable gloves.

This is the type of virus that causes COVID-19. The "2" is a way to say that this virus is different than the SARS virus that caused an outbreak in 2002-2003.	episode_done:True
text: what are symptoms of covid 19?	labels: People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. People with mild symptoms are able to recover at home. If you experience a medical emergency such as trouble breathing, call 911 and let the operator know you may have COVID-19. For severe illness, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.  Currently there are no FDA-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of COVID-19. Researchers are studying new drugs, and drugs that are already approved for other health conditions, as possible treatments for COVID-19. The FDA is working with drug manufacturers, researchers, and other partners to accelerate the development process for COVID-19 treatments. CDC has more information for health care providers about these potential treatments. Never take a prescription medicine or drug if it is not prescribed for you by your doctor for your health condition.	episode_done:True
text: How long will it last?	labels: How long you should be isolated for varies on a case-by-case basis. If you have been sick with COVID-19 and have been in isolation, you should talk to your healthcare provider to decide when you can be released from isolation. Your doctor will look for signs that:-You are fever-free without taking fever-reducing medication -You no longer show symptoms -Sometimes, your doctor might recommend testing respiratory samples to decide if you can be released from isolationOnce you have been released from isolation, then you are no longer considered to be likely to infect other people.	episode_done:True
text: How long will it last?	labels: A recent study shows that the virus can live in the air and on surfaces from several hours to several days. On plastic, it can live for up to 72 hours (3 days). On stainless steel, it can live for up to 48 hours (2 days). On cardboard, it can live up to 24 hours (1 day). On copper, it can live up to four hours. It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID-19 from these surfaces.  It is still important to regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces as well as packages and mail that come through. Remember to wash your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol based hand sanitizer (60%).	episode_done:True
text: How long will it last?	labels: Quarantine means staying away from other people because you might have been exposed to the virus. For COVID-19, people should quarantine for at least 14 days, or 2 weeks from the time they might have had contact with someone with COVID-19. That's because most people who get COVID-19 would have symptoms within 14 days. Scientists think that people are not likely to spread COVID-19 to others if they do not get sick after 14 days. Remember, every time you could have been exposed to the virus means you should restart your 14 day clock for quarantine.	episode_done:True

text: how is covid 19 spread?	labels: COVID-19 is contagious and it is actively spreading from person to person. The CDC recommends that those who have COVID-19 are isolated either at a hospital or at home, depending on how sick they are, until they are no longer at risk of infecting others.	episode_done:True
text: how is covid 19 spread?	labels: Quarantine means separating a person or group of people who have been exposed to a contagious disease but have not developed illness (symptoms) from others who have not been exposed, in order to prevent the possible spread of that disease. Quarantine is usually established for the incubation period of the communicable disease, which is the span of time during which people have developed illness after exposure. For COVID-19, the period of quarantine is 14 days from the last date of exposure because the incubation period for this virus is 2 to 14 days. Someone who has been released from COVID-19 quarantine is not considered a risk for spreading the virus to others because they have not developed illness during the incubation period.	episode_done:True

They should avoid groups of people and avoid visiting friends or public places.	episode_done:True
text: why is the virus called COVID 19?	labels: There has been a rise in stigma and hate crimes against Chinese and other Asian Americans, as well as people who were in quarantine. This is due to lack of knowledge around how COVID-19 spreads, a need to blame someone, fears about disease and death, as well as gossip that spreads rumors and myths.Stigma hurts everyone as it creates more fear and anger towards ordinary people, instead of the disease that is causing the problem, or towards systems that are not supporting people in accessing screening and treatment.

text: Should I wear a mask?	labels: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others. If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time. That is because there are not enough of these masks for health care workers. Health care workers need these masks to stay safe and to take care of sick patients. If you have extra surgical or N95 masks, please donate them to your local healthcare facility.	episode_done:True
text: Should I wear a mask?	labels: Children under the age of 2 years should not wear any type of masks. Because babies' airways are smaller, breathing through a mask is even harder on them and they are more likely to suffocate if they use a mask. Older infants or young toddlers are not likely to keep the mask on and will likely try to remove it. This will mean they are touching their face more and could infect themselves with the virus. It is safest to keep children at home and follow social distancing.	episode_done:True

text: what are the differences between the Flu and Covid 19?	labels: People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. People with mild symptoms are able to recover at home. If you experience a medical emergency such as trouble breathing, call 911 and let the operator know you may have COVID-19. For severe illness, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.  Currently there are no FDA-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of COVID-19. Researchers are studying new drugs, and drugs that are already approved for other health conditions, as possible treatments for COVID-19. The FDA is working with drug manufacturers, researchers, and other partners to accelerate the development process for COVID-19 treatments. CDC has more information for health care providers about these potential treatments.

text: Do I need to get tested if I don t have a fever?	labels: If you are having symptoms of COVID-19, call your health care provider for a referral. If you do not have a health care provider, call 2-1-1 to be connected with a local community or hospital-connected clinic for a referral to a test site. If you are having a medical emergency, call 9-1-1 or go to the hospital. Health care providers are encouraged to order a test for any child or adult who is showing symptoms of COVID-19, even if their symptoms are mild. Find out what to do if you are sick from the CDC and what to do while youâre waiting for test results. Pop-up Testing Sites Any Vermonter without symptoms can be tested at a pop-up testing site without a doctorâs referral. This includes people who work in Vermont, second homeowners, and college students. Registration for testing is required. For people who do not have internet access and want to register at a pop-up site, they can call 2-1-1 for help with registration. Register for a pop-up testing site. The test is a nasopharyngeal swab, or NP swab, where a health care professional uses a swab to collect a sample from the back of the nose and throat. This test will tell you if you have a current infection. It is not a serology/antibody test, which means it will not tell you if you were infected in the past. The following groups are encouraged to get tested at pop-up sites: health care workers, first responders (EMS, fire, and law enforcement), child care providers currently serving essential workers, and anyone currently under quarantine who has had no symptoms during the first seven days of quarantine. Find more details under âI am under a 14-day quarantine. Can I have the option to be tested and end my quarantine period?â on this page.	episode_done:True

text: Do I need to get tested if I don t have a fever?	labels: Staying at home and using "social distancing" helps stop the virus from spreading quickly. This helps to reduce the burden on healthcare systems, as there are not enough hospital workers and beds if too many people get sick at once.Social distancing means staying farther away from other people and avoiding groups of people. Since COVID-19 mostly spreads from person-to-person interactions, staying at least 6 feet away from other people can help stop the spread. It is important to use social distancing because people can spread COVID-19 even if they feel fine. It is especially important to use social distancing to protect people who are more likely to get very sick from the disease.	episode_done:True

text: Should we be wearing homemade masks when out shopping?	labels: Children under the age of 2 years should not wear any type of masks. Because babies' airways are smaller, breathing through a mask is even harder on them and they are more likely to suffocate if they use a mask. Older infants or young toddlers are not likely to keep the mask on and will likely try to remove it. This will mean they are touching their face more and could infect themselves with the virus. It is safest to keep children at home and follow social distancing.	episode_done:True
text: Should we be wearing homemade masks when out shopping?	labels: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others. If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time. That is because there are not enough of these masks for health care workers. Health care workers need these masks to stay safe and to take care of sick patients.

text: What are the symptoms in kids?	labels: Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. There are different types of coronaviruses.Some types of coronavirus are more common in people and some versions are more common in animals. Rarely, a type of the virus that was common in animals can spread to people. "Coronavirus Disease 2019” (which is shortened to "COVID-19") is an example of a type of coronavirus that has recently spread to humans.	episode_done:True

text: What COVID 19 symptoms require that I seek medical help?	labels: Together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19 by making a conscious effort to keep a physical distance between each other. Physical (social) distancing is proven to be one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of illness during an outbreak. This means making changes in your everyday routines to minimize close contact with others, including:avoiding crowded places and non-essential gatherings avoiding common greetings, such as handshakes limiting contact with people at higher risk like older adults and those in poor health keeping a distance of at least 2 arms-length (approximately 2 metres) from others	episode_done:True
text: What COVID 19 symptoms require that I seek medical help?	labels: COVID-19 is a disease caused by a new type of virus. Sometimes people also call it "coronavirus," which is is the type of virus that causes COVID-19. COVID-19 causes some symptoms that are like getting a cold or flu. But some people get worse symptoms and need more care. COVID-19 is caused by a new type of virus that our body has not seen before. Since our body has not seen it before, our immune system has to learn how to fight off this new virus.	episode_done:True

text: What COVID 19 symptoms require that I seek medical help?	labels: SARS-COV-2 is the name for the virus that causes the disease known as "COVID-19." Let's break it down."SARS" stands for "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome", meaning that it can cause serious problems with breathing and the lungs."COV" stands for "Coronavirus." This is the type of virus that causes COVID-19. The "2" is a way to say that this virus is different than the SARS virus that caused an outbreak in 2002-2003.	episode_done:True
text: Is chloroquine effective in treating COVID-19?	labels: Chloroquine Phosphate is the phosphate salt of chloroquine. Chloroquine is a medication primarily used to prevent and treat malaria. Chloroquine comes in tablet form as the phosphate, sulfate, and hydrochloride salts.	episode_done:True
text: Is chloroquine effective in treating COVID-19?	labels: In the lab, these drugs have been shown to prevent the growth of the virus that causes COVID-19. There are a few reports of patients with COVID-19 who received these drugs and improved. Some are reports of groups of patients, all of whom received the drug. It is not known whether it was the drug that led to the improvement or whether there were other factors involved. We do not know if the treated patients’ condition would have improved without the drug. To know this, there would have to be a group of similar patients who did not receive the drug (control). Because chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine may possibly help very sick patients, FDA is allowing these drugs to be provided to certain hospitalized patients under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) issued March 28, 2020.  Under the EUA, health care providers and patients are provided with information about the risks of these drugs. However, more data from clinical trials are necessary for us to determine whether chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate are safe and effective in treating or preventing COVID-19.	episode_done:True

text: Is chloroquine effective in treating COVID-19?	labels: In general, virus's genetic material can change over time. However, there is no guarantee these changes will make the virus weaker. We can not predict if the virus causing COVID-19 will become weak with time.	episode_done:True
text: If I get sick but it seems like a cold how long do I have to wait after feeling better to see other people?	labels: How long you should be isolated for varies on a case-by-case basis. If you have been sick with COVID-19 and have been in isolation, you should talk to your healthcare provider to decide when you can be released from isolation. Your doctor will look for signs that:-You are fever-free without taking fever-reducing medication -You no longer show symptoms -Sometimes, your doctor might recommend testing respiratory samples to decide if you can be released from isolationOnce you have been released from isolation, then you are no longer considered to be likely to infect other people.	episode_done:True
text: If I get sick but it seems like a cold how long do I have to wait after feeling better to see other people?	labels: Social distancing helps to reduce the chance of infecting people who are more likely to get severe disease. It helps to stop the virus from spreading quickly. This also helps to prevent there being too many sick people for hospitals to handle.	episode_done:True
text: If I get sick but it seems like a cold how long do I have to wait after feeling better to see other people?	labels: Staying at home and using "social distancing" helps stop the virus from spreading quickly. This helps to reduce the burden on healthcare systems, as there are not enough hospital workers and beds if too many people get sick at once.Social distancing means staying farther away from other people and avoiding groups of people. Since COVID-19 mostly spreads from person-to-person interactions, staying at least 6 feet away from other people can help stop the spread. It is important to use social distancing because people can spread COVID-19 even if they feel fine. It is especially important to use social distancing to protect people who are more likely to get very sick from the disease.	episode_done:True
text: If I get sick but it seems like a cold how long do I have to wait after feeling better to see other people?	labels: Right now, we don't know of any clear cases of the virus passing from people to their pets. There was a tiger in a zoo in New York City that seems to have gotten COVID-19 from its caretakers. To be safe, wash your hands before and after touching animals. Until we know more, if you have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and have a pet or other animal, you should:1. Avoid close contact with them. Do not snuggle or kiss them, let them lick you, sit on your lap, or sleep in your bed. 2. Avoid coughing and sneezing on your animals. Cover your coughs and sneezes. 3. Have another member of your household care for your animals, if you can. 4. If it's not possible to have someone else care for your animal, always wash your hands before touching or feeding them. 5. Limit your animal's contact with other people and animals. Tthis may mean keeping them indoors.We might learn more about human to animal spread in the future. Talk to your pet's doctor if you are worried about your pet's health.	episode_done:True
text: If I get sick but it seems like a cold how long do I have to wait after feeling better to see other people?	labels: Right now, COVID-19 mostly spreads from person to person. But experts agree that the virus likely came from bats and may have passed through another type of animal in China before spreading to people. If you are going to travel, check the latest health notices for up-to-date advice before you leave. Avoid contact with animals, including wild meat and live animal markets.Animal importers, rescues, and adoptive families should limit or postpone importing animals from affected areas. If animals are imported from an affected area, monitor them closely for illness. Call a veterinarian if they get sick and call before bringing them to the office so that they can prepare.	episode_done:True
text: Can the virus travel through air or does there need to be physical contact?	labels: According to the WHO, these droplets are heavy enough that they cannot travel more than around 3 feet (1 meter). However, other research has found they can travel 23–27 feet (7–8 meters).	episode_done:True
text: Can the virus travel through air or does there need to be physical contact?	labels: There is currently no evidence to suggest that food is a likely way of spreading COVID-19. Food safety experts are closely watching the spread of COVID-19.	episode_done:True
text: Can the virus travel through air or does there need to be physical contact?	labels: Current thinking is that COVID-19 mostly spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets. But some studies show that the virus can last on surfaces, so it is possible that someone could get the virus by touching a surface that has the virus on it and then touching their mouth, nose, or eyes.	episode_done:True
text: Can the virus travel through air or does there need to be physical contact?	labels: Current thinking is that COVID-19 mostly spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets. Scientists are still studying how long coronavirus lives on surfaces. In general, you should practice good hygiene and food safety practices. This means cleaning surfaces that are used a lot, cleaning your fruits and vegetables, and cooking meats well. Wash your hands with soap and water before handling food.	episode_done:True
text: Can the virus travel through air or does there need to be physical contact?	labels: Travellers should adhere to strict hygiene measures, wash hands with soap and water regularly, and/or use alcohol-based hand sanitisers. Touching the face with unwashed hands should be avoided. Travellers should avoid contact with sick persons, in particular those with respiratory symptoms and fever. It should be emphasised that older people and those with underlying health conditions should take these precautionary measures very seriously. Travellers who develop any symptoms during or after travel should self-isolate; those developing acute respiratory symptoms within 14 days upon return should be advised to seek immediate medical advice, ideally by phone first to their national healthcare provider.	episode_done:True
text: what symptoms you have?	labels: If you don't have access to hand sanitizer, soap and water are always the best option.Make sure any hand santizer you have has at least 60% alcohol, as recommended by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Any hand sanitizer that has less than 60% alcohol will not be effective at killing the virus.	episode_done:True

text: I have a sore throat what other symptoms should I be waiting for before getting tested?	labels: If you are having symptoms of COVID-19, call your health care provider to be tested. If you do not have a health care provider, call 2-1-1 to be connected with a local community or hospital-connected clinic for referral to a test site. Health care providers are encouraged to order a test for any child or adult who is showing symptoms of COVID-19, even if their symptoms are mild.	episode_done:True
text: I have a sore throat what other symptoms should I be waiting for before getting tested?	labels: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others. If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time. That is because there are not enough of these masks for health care workers. Health care workers need these masks to stay safe and to take care of sick patients. If you have extra surgical or N95 masks, please donate them to your local healthcare facility.	episode_done:True
text: I have a sore throat what other symptoms should I be waiting for before getting tested?	labels: If you do not have any symptoms, you will be asked to:1. Self-quarantine for 14 days after you get home.2. Do not have any visitors, especially older adults, or those with health problems who are higher risk of severe illness. 3. Monitor your health for fever, cough, or trouble breathing. 4. Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use an alcohol based hand sanitizer that is at least 60% alcohol. 5. Cover your mouth and nose with your arm or a tissue when coughing or sneezing. Throw away the tissue right after and wash your hands. If you start to have symptoms like a cough or fever within the 14 days:1. Continue to self-isolate from others.2. Call a healthcare professional or a public health authority and tell them your symptoms and travel history. Follow their instructions.3.If your symptoms are severe - such as pain or pressure in the chest that won't go away, trouble breathing, feeling confused or unable to arouse, or lips or face that look blue, seek medical care right away. Please contact your medical provider if you have questions about your health and safety.	episode_done:True

text: What are the symptoms of Corona Virus?	labels: Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. There are different types of coronaviruses.Some types of coronavirus are more common in people and some versions are more common in animals. Rarely, a type of the virus that was common in animals can spread to people. "Coronavirus Disease 2019” (which is shortened to "COVID-19") is an example of a type of coronavirus that has recently spread to humans.	episode_done:True
text: What are the symptoms of Corona Virus?	labels: COVID-19 is a disease caused by a new type of virus. Sometimes people also call it "coronavirus," which is is the type of virus that causes COVID-19. COVID-19 causes some symptoms that are like getting a cold or flu. But some people get worse symptoms and need more care. COVID-19 is caused by a new type of virus that our body has not seen before. Since our body has not seen it before, our immune system has to learn how to fight off this new virus.	episode_done:True
text: I am regularly travelling by bus?	labels: Right now, COVID-19 mostly spreads from person to person. But experts agree that the virus likely came from bats and may have passed through another type of animal in China before spreading to people. If you are going to travel, check the latest health notices for up-to-date advice before you leave. Avoid contact with animals, including wild meat and live animal markets.Animal importers, rescues, and adoptive families should limit or postpone importing animals from affected areas. If animals are imported from an affected area, monitor them closely for illness. Call a veterinarian if they get sick and call before bringing them to the office so that they can prepare.	episode_done:True
text: I am regularly travelling by bus?	labels: Because COVID-19 is a new disease, we are still learning how it affects pregnant women. At this time, there is no evidence to suggest that pregnant women are at a greater risk for more serious outcomes related to COVID-19 or that their developing child could be negatively affected by COVID-19. You can protect yourself from becoming ill by taking the following precautions:stay home as much as possible, except for important medical appointments talk to your doctor, obstetrician or midwife about the possibility of telephone or videoconference appointments avoid unnecessary visitors to your home wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds use alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available practise physical distancing by keeping a distance of at least 2 metres from others avoid touching your mouth, nose and eyes avoid crowded places and peak-hours make limited trips to the store for essentials avoid travel by public transitFor more information, refer to our advice for motherson pregnancy, childbirth and caring for newborns. If you are pregnant and concerned about COVID-19, speak to your health care provider.	episode_done:True

text: I am regularly travelling by bus?	labels: Pregnant women should do the same things as everyone else to avoid COVID-19 infection, including: Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, you can use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Clean and disinfect frequently-touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash and wash your hands. Stay home when you are sick. When you must go out, practice social distancing.	episode_done:True
text: I am regularly travelling by bus?	labels: Travellers should adhere to strict hygiene measures, wash hands with soap and water regularly, and/or use alcohol-based hand sanitisers. Touching the face with unwashed hands should be avoided. Travellers should avoid contact with sick persons, in particular those with respiratory symptoms and fever. It should be emphasised that older people and those with underlying health conditions should take these precautionary measures very seriously. Travellers who develop any symptoms during or after travel should self-isolate; those developing acute respiratory symptoms within 14 days upon return should be advised to seek immediate medical advice, ideally by phone first to their national healthcare provider.	episode_done:True
text: Why do I need to wash my hands?	labels: Social distancing helps to reduce the chance of infecting people who are more likely to get severe disease. It helps to stop the virus from spreading quickly. This also helps to prevent there being too many sick people for hospitals to handle.	episode_done:True
text: Why do I need to wash my hands?	labels: Staying at home and using "social distancing" helps stop the virus from spreading quickly. This helps to reduce the burden on healthcare systems, as there are not enough hospital workers and beds if too many people get sick at once.Social distancing means staying farther away from other people and avoiding groups of people. Since COVID-19 mostly spreads from person-to-person interactions, staying at least 6 feet away from other people can help stop the spread. It is important to use social distancing because people can spread COVID-19 even if they feel fine.

Let's break it down."SARS" stands for "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome", meaning that it can cause serious problems with breathing and the lungs."COV" stands for "Coronavirus." This is the type of virus that causes COVID-19. The "2" is a way to say that this virus is different than the SARS virus that caused an outbreak in 2002-2003.	episode_done:True
text: What are COVID symptoms at early stage?	labels: People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. People with mild symptoms are able to recover at home. If you experience a medical emergency such as trouble breathing, call 911 and let the operator know you may have COVID-19. For severe illness, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.  Currently there are no FDA-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of COVID-19. Researchers are studying new drugs, and drugs that are already approved for other health conditions, as possible treatments for COVID-19. The FDA is working with drug manufacturers, researchers, and other partners to accelerate the development process for COVID-19 treatments. CDC has more information for health care providers about these potential treatments. Never take a prescription medicine or drug if it is not prescribed for you by your doctor for your health condition.	episode_done:True
text: How long does the virus stay on surface?	labels: Current thinking is that COVID-19 mostly spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets. But some studies show that the virus can last on surfaces, so it is possible that someone could get the virus by touching a surface that has the virus on it and then touching their mouth, nose, or eyes.	episode_done:True
text: How long does the virus stay on surface?	labels: A recent study shows that the virus can live in the air and on surfaces from several hours to several days. On plastic, it can live for up to 72 hours (3 days). On stainless steel, it can live for up to 48 hours (2 days). On cardboard, it can live up to 24 hours (1 day). On copper, it can live up to four hours. It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID-19 from these surfaces.  It is still important to regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces as well as packages and mail that come through. Remember to wash your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol based hand sanitizer (60%).	episode_done:True

text: How fast does the virus spread?	labels: Community spread means people have been infected with the virus in an area, including some who are not sure how or where they became infected.	episode_done:True
text: How fast does the virus spread?	labels: A recent study shows that the virus can live in the air and on surfaces from several hours to several days. On plastic, it can live for up to 72 hours (3 days). On stainless steel, it can live for up to 48 hours (2 days). On cardboard, it can live up to 24 hours (1 day). On copper, it can live up to four hours. It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID-19 from these surfaces.  It is still important to regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces as well as packages and mail that come through. Remember to wash your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol based hand sanitizer (60%).	episode_done:True
text: How fast does the virus spread?	labels: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others. If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time. That is because there are not enough of these masks for health care workers. Health care workers need these masks to stay safe and to take care of sick patients. If you have extra surgical or N95 masks, please donate them to your local healthcare facility.	episode_done:True
text: How fast does the virus spread?	labels: Current thinking is that COVID-19 mostly spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets.

text: My mom came back from a trip on the 20th of March Until when is she supposed to stay home?	labels: Staying at home and using "social distancing" helps stop the virus from spreading quickly. This helps to reduce the burden on healthcare systems, as there are not enough hospital workers and beds if too many people get sick at once.Social distancing means staying farther away from other people and avoiding groups of people. Since COVID-19 mostly spreads from person-to-person interactions, staying at least 6 feet away from other people can help stop the spread. It is important to use social distancing because people can spread COVID-19 even if they feel fine. It is especially important to use social distancing to protect people who are more likely to get very sick from the disease.	episode_done:True
text: My mom came back from a trip on the 20th of March Until when is she supposed to stay home?	labels: If you do not have any symptoms, you will be asked to:1. Self-quarantine for 14 days after you get home.2. Do not have any visitors, especially older adults, or those with health problems who are higher risk of severe illness. 3. Monitor your health for fever, cough, or trouble breathing. 4. Wash your hands frequently with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, or use an alcohol based hand sanitizer that is at least 60% alcohol. 5. Cover your mouth and nose with your arm or a tissue when coughing or sneezing. Throw away the tissue right after and wash your hands. If you start to have symptoms like a cough or fever within the 14 days:1. Continue to self-isolate from others.2. Call a healthcare professional or a public health authority and tell them your symptoms and travel history. Follow their instructions.3.If your symptoms are severe - such as pain or pressure in the chest that won't go away, trouble breathing, feeling confused or unable to arouse, or lips or face that look blue, seek medical care right away.

text: what are he covid symptoms?	labels: People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. People with mild symptoms are able to recover at home. If you experience a medical emergency such as trouble breathing, call 911 and let the operator know you may have COVID-19. For severe illness, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.  Currently there are no FDA-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of COVID-19. Researchers are studying new drugs, and drugs that are already approved for other health conditions, as possible treatments for COVID-19. The FDA is working with drug manufacturers, researchers, and other partners to accelerate the development process for COVID-19 treatments. CDC has more information for health care providers about these potential treatments.

Pop-up Testing Sites Any Vermonter without symptoms can be tested at a pop-up testing site without a doctorâs referral. This includes people who work in Vermont, second homeowners, and college students. Registration for testing is required. For people who do not have internet access and want to register at a pop-up site, they can call 2-1-1 for help with registration. Register for a pop-up testing site. The test is a nasopharyngeal swab, or NP swab, where a health care professional uses a swab to collect a sample from the back of the nose and throat. This test will tell you if you have a current infection. It is not a serology/antibody test, which means it will not tell you if you were infected in the past. The following groups are encouraged to get tested at pop-up sites: health care workers, first responders (EMS, fire, and law enforcement), child care providers currently serving essential workers, and anyone currently under quarantine who has had no symptoms during the first seven days of quarantine.

This includes when you're inside a store or outside for exercise. The COVID-19 virus spreads easily from person-to-person. It travels through the air when a sick person coughs, sneezes or talks. One way to contain the spread of COVID-19 is to stop people from sharing it. Without a vaccine or treatment, we can help contain the virus by: Staying at home to protect others if you are sick. Staying home is still the best way to lower our risk of COVID-19, but small groups of 10 or fewer people are now allowed if health and safety precautions are followed. Learn how to safely connect with friends and family. Continuing to go outside, take walks, do essential errands while maintaining a physical distance from others and practicing proper hygiene.

Pop-up Testing Sites Any Vermonter without symptoms can be tested at a pop-up testing site without a doctorâs referral. This includes people who work in Vermont, second homeowners, and college students. Registration for testing is required. For people who do not have internet access and want to register at a pop-up site, they can call 2-1-1 for help with registration. Register for a pop-up testing site. The test is a nasopharyngeal swab, or NP swab, where a health care professional uses a swab to collect a sample from the back of the nose and throat. This test will tell you if you have a current infection. It is not a serology/antibody test, which means it will not tell you if you were infected in the past. The following groups are encouraged to get tested at pop-up sites: health care workers, first responders (EMS, fire, and law enforcement), child care providers currently serving essential workers, and anyone currently under quarantine who has had no symptoms during the first seven days of quarantine. Find more details under âI am under a 14-day quarantine. Can I have the option to be tested and end my quarantine period?â on this page.	episode_done:True
text: Where did COVID 19 started?	labels: COVID-19 is a disease caused by a new type of virus. Sometimes people also call it "coronavirus," which is is the type of virus that causes COVID-19. COVID-19 causes some symptoms that are like getting a cold or flu. But some people get worse symptoms and need more care. COVID-19 is caused by a new type of virus that our body has not seen before. Since our body has not seen it before, our immune system has to learn how to fight off this new virus.	episode_done:True

text: Is there any way to assess the susceptibility of a person towards the coronavirus?	labels: People might be able to spread the disease before people realize they are sick. But most scientists think that people are most likely to infect others when they have symptoms and feel sick. Canada public health services is doing research to try to answer this question.	episode_done:True

text: Is there any way to assess the susceptibility of a person towards the coronavirus?	labels: In general, a negative or normal result means that the virus that causes COVID-19 was not found in the sample. But sometimes if a person has COVID-19 in the early stages, they could test negative at first, but test positive later on, when there is more virus present. You healthcare provider can help decide if you should be tested again.	episode_done:True
text: Is there any way to assess the susceptibility of a person towards the coronavirus?	labels: Like other viruses, it is possible that the virus that causes COVID-19 can stay on surfaces and objects. Here are some tips to reduce risk while grocery shopping: 1. Shop when stores are less busy 2. Disinfect the shopping cart at the grocery store3. Stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from others while shopping 4. Avoid touching your face while shopping5. While paying, avoid hand-to-hand cash transfers.

text: Is there any way to assess the susceptibility of a person towards the coronavirus?	labels: Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. There are different types of coronaviruses.Some types of coronavirus are more common in people and some versions are more common in animals. Rarely, a type of the virus that was common in animals can spread to people. "Coronavirus Disease 2019” (which is shortened to "COVID-19") is an example of a type of coronavirus that has recently spread to humans.	episode_done:True
text: How long does covid live on packages?	labels: A recent study shows that the virus can live in the air and on surfaces from several hours to several days. On plastic, it can live for up to 72 hours (3 days). On stainless steel, it can live for up to 48 hours (2 days). On cardboard, it can live up to 24 hours (1 day). On copper, it can live up to four hours. It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID-19 from these surfaces.  It is still important to regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces as well as packages and mail that come through. Remember to wash your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol based hand sanitizer (60%).	episode_done:True
text: How long does covid live on packages?	labels: COVID-19 can spread in a few different ways. It can spread from person to person if you inhale an infected person's respiratory droplets when they sneezes, coughs, or talk. It can also spead if you touch something that an infected person has touched, like a door knob, elevator button, or bathroom faucet.That's why it's important to wash your hands, avoid touching your face, and practice social distancing to avoid getting sick. That's why it's also important to self-isolate and wear a mask around other household members if you are sick to avoid infecting other people.	episode_done:True
text: How long does covid live on packages?	labels: In the lab, these drugs have been shown to prevent the growth of the virus that causes COVID-19. There are a few reports of patients with COVID-19 who received these drugs and improved. Some are reports of groups of patients, all of whom received the drug. It is not known whether it was the drug that led to the improvement or whether there were other factors involved. We do not know if the treated patients’ condition would have improved without the drug. To know this, there would have to be a group of similar patients who did not receive the drug (control). Because chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine may possibly help very sick patients, FDA is allowing these drugs to be provided to certain hospitalized patients under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) issued March 28, 2020.  Under the EUA, health care providers and patients are provided with information about the risks of these drugs. However, more data from clinical trials are necessary for us to determine whether chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate are safe and effective in treating or preventing COVID-19.	episode_done:True
text: How long does covid live on packages?	labels: Together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19 by making a conscious effort to keep a physical distance between each other. Physical (social) distancing is proven to be one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of illness during an outbreak. This means making changes in your everyday routines to minimize close contact with others, including:avoiding crowded places and non-essential gatherings avoiding common greetings, such as handshakes limiting contact with people at higher risk like older adults and those in poor health keeping a distance of at least 2 arms-length (approximately 2 metres) from others	episode_done:True

text: Why do they continue to ask me if I travelled when 40 of cases are now community acquired It seems that they are dismissing me even though I could be positive?	labels: Social distancing helps to reduce the chance of infecting people who are more likely to get severe disease. It helps to stop the virus from spreading quickly. This also helps to prevent there being too many sick people for hospitals to handle.	episode_done:True
text: Why do they continue to ask me if I travelled when 40 of cases are now community acquired It seems that they are dismissing me even though I could be positive?	labels: Staying at home and using "social distancing" helps stop the virus from spreading quickly. This helps to reduce the burden on healthcare systems, as there are not enough hospital workers and beds if too many people get sick at once.Social distancing means staying farther away from other people and avoiding groups of people. Since COVID-19 mostly spreads from person-to-person interactions, staying at least 6 feet away from other people can help stop the spread. It is important to use social distancing because people can spread COVID-19 even if they feel fine. It is especially important to use social distancing to protect people who are more likely to get very sick from the disease.	episode_done:True
text: Why do they continue to ask me if I travelled when 40 of cases are now community acquired It seems that they are dismissing me even though I could be positive?	labels: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others. If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time. That is because there are not enough of these masks for health care workers. Health care workers need these masks to stay safe and to take care of sick patients. If you have extra surgical or N95 masks, please donate them to your local healthcare facility.	episode_done:True

text: Can you get covid from eating food that someone with covid sneezed or coughed on?	labels: Right now, we don't know of any clear cases of the virus passing from people to their pets. There was a tiger in a zoo in New York City that seems to have gotten COVID-19 from its caretakers. To be safe, wash your hands before and after touching animals. Until we know more, if you have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and have a pet or other animal, you should:1. Avoid close contact with them. Do not snuggle or kiss them, let them lick you, sit on your lap, or sleep in your bed. 2. Avoid coughing and sneezing on your animals. Cover your coughs and sneezes. 3. Have another member of your household care for your animals, if you can. 4. If it's not possible to have someone else care for your animal, always wash your hands before touching or feeding them. 5.

text: Can you get covid from eating food that someone with covid sneezed or coughed on?	labels: Right now, COVID-19 mostly spreads from person to person. But experts agree that the virus likely came from bats and may have passed through another type of animal in China before spreading to people. If you are going to travel, check the latest health notices for up-to-date advice before you leave. Avoid contact with animals, including wild meat and live animal markets.Animal importers, rescues, and adoptive families should limit or postpone importing animals from affected areas. If animals are imported from an affected area, monitor them closely for illness.

text: What are the most common COVID 19 symptoms?	labels: Those who are infected with COVID-19 may have little to no symptoms. You may not know you have symptoms of COVID-19 because they are similar to a cold or flu. Symptoms haveincluded:cough fever difficulty breathing pneumonia in both lungsIn severe cases, infection can leadto death.Symptoms may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to COVID-19. This is the longest known incubation period for this disease.Recent evidence indicates that the virus can be transmitted to othersfrom someone who is infected but not showing symptoms. This includes peoplewho:have not yet developed symptoms (pre-symptomatic) never develop symptoms (asymptomatic)While experts know that these kinds of transmissions are happening amongthose in close contact or in close physical settings, it is not known to whatextent.

If you experience a medical emergency such as trouble breathing, call 911 and let the operator know you may have COVID-19. For severe illness, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.  Currently there are no FDA-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of COVID-19. Researchers are studying new drugs, and drugs that are already approved for other health conditions, as possible treatments for COVID-19. The FDA is working with drug manufacturers, researchers, and other partners to accelerate the development process for COVID-19 treatments. CDC has more information for health care providers about these potential treatments.

text: How long should I stay home if I have symptoms?	labels: The risk of COVID-19 spreading from products or packaging shipped over a period of days or weeks is likely to be low. Currently, there is no evidence that COVID-19 has been spread from imported goods.	episode_done:True
text: Is there a medication to take to help me fight covid 19?	labels: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others. If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time. That is because there are not enough of these masks for health care workers. Health care workers need these masks to stay safe and to take care of sick patients. If you have extra surgical or N95 masks, please donate them to your local healthcare facility.	episode_done:True

text: why is social distancing important?	labels: Social distancing means maintaining a physical distance (approximately 6 feet or 2 meters) from others you do not live with. This includes when you're inside a store or outside for exercise. The COVID-19 virus spreads easily from person-to-person. It travels through the air when a sick person coughs, sneezes or talks. One way to contain the spread of COVID-19 is to stop people from sharing it. Without a vaccine or treatment, we can help contain the virus by: Staying at home to protect others if you are sick. Staying home is still the best way to lower our risk of COVID-19, but small groups of 10 or fewer people are now allowed if health and safety precautions are followed. Learn how to safely connect with friends and family. Continuing to go outside, take walks, do essential errands while maintaining a physical distance from others and practicing proper hygiene.

text: How long should we try to maintain social distancing?	labels: Social distancing means maintaining a physical distance (approximately 6 feet or 2 meters) from others you do not live with. This includes when you're inside a store or outside for exercise. The COVID-19 virus spreads easily from person-to-person. It travels through the air when a sick person coughs, sneezes or talks. One way to contain the spread of COVID-19 is to stop people from sharing it. Without a vaccine or treatment, we can help contain the virus by: Staying at home to protect others if you are sick. Staying home is still the best way to lower our risk of COVID-19, but small groups of 10 or fewer people are now allowed if health and safety precautions are followed. Learn how to safely connect with friends and family. Continuing to go outside, take walks, do essential errands while maintaining a physical distance from others and practicing proper hygiene. Remember that ticks are active this time of year. Find out how to Be Tick Smart and prevent tick bites. Wearing a cloth face mask or covering in public settings when a physical distance of at least 6 feet is difficult to maintain, especially at the grocery store, pharmacy, doctorâs office, hospital or other essential business or office, and on a crowded sidewalk or bike path. Washing your hands (adults and children) any time you go inside, before you eat, and before you spend time with people who are more vulnerable to the effects of COVID-19.	episode_done:True
text: How long should we try to maintain social distancing?	labels: There is currently no evidence that COVID-19 is being spread through the mail. Coronaviruses do not survive well on surfaces.

text: can I get infected from a newspaper?	labels: Right now, COVID-19 mostly spreads from person to person. But experts agree that the virus likely came from bats and may have passed through another type of animal in China before spreading to people. If you are going to travel, check the latest health notices for up-to-date advice before you leave. Avoid contact with animals, including wild meat and live animal markets.Animal importers, rescues, and adoptive families should limit or postpone importing animals from affected areas. If animals are imported from an affected area, monitor them closely for illness.

text: can I get infected from a newspaper?	labels: If you are having symptoms of COVID-19, call your health care provider for a referral. If you do not have a health care provider, call 2-1-1 to be connected with a local community or hospital-connected clinic for a referral to a test site. If you are having a medical emergency, call 9-1-1 or go to the hospital. Health care providers are encouraged to order a test for any child or adult who is showing symptoms of COVID-19, even if their symptoms are mild. Find out what to do if you are sick from the CDC and what to do while youâre waiting for test results. Pop-up Testing Sites Any Vermonter without symptoms can be tested at a pop-up testing site without a doctorâs referral. This includes people who work in Vermont, second homeowners, and college students. Registration for testing is required. For people who do not have internet access and want to register at a pop-up site, they can call 2-1-1 for help with registration. Register for a pop-up testing site. The test is a nasopharyngeal swab, or NP swab, where a health care professional uses a swab to collect a sample from the back of the nose and throat. This test will tell you if you have a current infection. It is not a serology/antibody test, which means it will not tell you if you were infected in the past. The following groups are encouraged to get tested at pop-up sites: health care workers, first responders (EMS, fire, and law enforcement), child care providers currently serving essential workers, and anyone currently under quarantine who has had no symptoms during the first seven days of quarantine.

text: can I get infected from a newspaper?	labels: Right now, we don't know of any clear cases of the virus passing from people to their pets. There was a tiger in a zoo in New York City that seems to have gotten COVID-19 from its caretakers. To be safe, wash your hands before and after touching animals. Until we know more, if you have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and have a pet or other animal, you should:1. Avoid close contact with them. Do not snuggle or kiss them, let them lick you, sit on your lap, or sleep in your bed. 2. Avoid coughing and sneezing on your animals. Cover your coughs and sneezes. 3. Have another member of your household care for your animals, if you can. 4. If it's not possible to have someone else care for your animal, always wash your hands before touching or feeding them. 5. Limit your animal's contact with other people and animals. Tthis may mean keeping them indoors.We might learn more about human to animal spread in the future.

We are still learning how COVID-19 spreads and if a deceased body can transmit the virus. One could get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it, and then touching their face (like their mouth, nose, or eyes). Try to avoid kissing washing, and shrouding the body. If washing and shrouding the body are important in your culture or religion, work with your community cultural and religious leaders as well as funeral home staff to try to reduce exposure as much as possible. People who conduct these activities should wear disposable gloves. If fluid splashing is expected, more personal protective equipment may be needed, such as disposable gowns, goggles, and face masks.	episode_done:True
text: Is it best to stay at home if I have symptoms?	labels: Staying at home and using "social distancing" helps stop the virus from spreading quickly. This helps to reduce the burden on healthcare systems, as there are not enough hospital workers and beds if too many people get sick at once.Social distancing means staying farther away from other people and avoiding groups of people. Since COVID-19 mostly spreads from person-to-person interactions, staying at least 6 feet away from other people can help stop the spread. It is important to use social distancing because people can spread COVID-19 even if they feel fine. It is especially important to use social distancing to protect people who are more likely to get very sick from the disease.	episode_done:True

text: What are the symptoms?	labels: Those who are infected with COVID-19 may have little to no symptoms. You may not know you have symptoms of COVID-19 because they are similar to a cold or flu. Symptoms haveincluded:cough fever difficulty breathing pneumonia in both lungsIn severe cases, infection can leadto death.Symptoms may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to COVID-19. This is the longest known incubation period for this disease.Recent evidence indicates that the virus can be transmitted to othersfrom someone who is infected but not showing symptoms. This includes peoplewho:have not yet developed symptoms (pre-symptomatic) never develop symptoms (asymptomatic)While experts know that these kinds of transmissions are happening amongthose in close contact or in close physical settings, it is not known to whatextent. This means it is extremely important to follow the proven preventative measures.Think you might have COVID-19? Take a self-assessment	episode_done:True
text: What are the symptoms?	labels: Children and adults have the same COVID-19 symptoms, although children might not get as sick as adults. Children might get a fever, runny nose, or cough. Some children have had vomiting or diarrhea. We are still learning about how COVID-19 affects children.	episode_done:True
text: What are the symptoms?	labels: People might be able to spread the disease before people realize they are sick. But most scientists think that people are most likely to infect others when they have symptoms and feel sick. Canada public health services is doing research to try to answer this question.	episode_done:True
text: What are the symptoms?	labels: Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. There are different types of coronaviruses.Some types of coronavirus are more common in people and some versions are more common in animals. Rarely, a type of the virus that was common in animals can spread to people. "Coronavirus Disease 2019” (which is shortened to "COVID-19") is an example of a type of coronavirus that has recently spread to humans.	episode_done:True
text: What are the symptoms?	labels: COVID-19 is a disease caused by a new type of virus. Sometimes people also call it "coronavirus," which is is the type of virus that causes COVID-19. COVID-19 causes some symptoms that are like getting a cold or flu. But some people get worse symptoms and need more care. COVID-19 is caused by a new type of virus that our body has not seen before. Since our body has not seen it before, our immune system has to learn how to fight off this new virus.	episode_done:True
text: How long do I need to have a fever for me to start worrying?	labels: How long you should be isolated for varies on a case-by-case basis. If you have been sick with COVID-19 and have been in isolation, you should talk to your healthcare provider to decide when you can be released from isolation. Your doctor will look for signs that:-You are fever-free without taking fever-reducing medication -You no longer show symptoms -Sometimes, your doctor might recommend testing respiratory samples to decide if you can be released from isolationOnce you have been released from isolation, then you are no longer considered to be likely to infect other people.	episode_done:True
text: How long do I need to have a fever for me to start worrying?	labels: Social distancing helps to reduce the chance of infecting people who are more likely to get severe disease. It helps to stop the virus from spreading quickly. This also helps to prevent there being too many sick people for hospitals to handle.	episode_done:True
text: How long do I need to have a fever for me to start worrying?	labels: Staying at home and using "social distancing" helps stop the virus from spreading quickly. This helps to reduce the burden on healthcare systems, as there are not enough hospital workers and beds if too many people get sick at once.Social distancing means staying farther away from other people and avoiding groups of people. Since COVID-19 mostly spreads from person-to-person interactions, staying at least 6 feet away from other people can help stop the spread. It is important to use social distancing because people can spread COVID-19 even if they feel fine. It is especially important to use social distancing to protect people who are more likely to get very sick from the disease.	episode_done:True
text: How long do I need to have a fever for me to start worrying?	labels: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others. If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time. That is because there are not enough of these masks for health care workers. Health care workers need these masks to stay safe and to take care of sick patients. If you have extra surgical or N95 masks, please donate them to your local healthcare facility.	episode_done:True
text: How long do I need to have a fever for me to start worrying?	labels: It is a challenging time with schools, daycares and unversities being closed. Talk to the  school or facility  about their emergency operations plan. Understand the plan for continuing education and social services (such as student meal programs) during school dismissals. If your child attends a  college or university , encourage them to learn about the school’s plan for a COVID-19 outbreak.	episode_done:True

Let's break it down."SARS" stands for "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome", meaning that it can cause serious problems with breathing and the lungs."COV" stands for "Coronavirus." This is the type of virus that causes COVID-19. The "2" is a way to say that this virus is different than the SARS virus that caused an outbreak in 2002-2003.	episode_done:True
text: what are the symptoms of COVID 19?	labels: People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. People with mild symptoms are able to recover at home. If you experience a medical emergency such as trouble breathing, call 911 and let the operator know you may have COVID-19. For severe illness, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.  Currently there are no FDA-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of COVID-19. Researchers are studying new drugs, and drugs that are already approved for other health conditions, as possible treatments for COVID-19. The FDA is working with drug manufacturers, researchers, and other partners to accelerate the development process for COVID-19 treatments. CDC has more information for health care providers about these potential treatments. Never take a prescription medicine or drug if it is not prescribed for you by your doctor for your health condition.	episode_done:True

text: Is washing my hands really the best way to prevent transmission?	labels: You can reduce your risk of getting sick by:1. Staying at home as much as you can. Only go out when you really need to (for groceries, for example) 2. If you do go out, keep at least 6 foot (2 meter) distance between you and other people. 3. Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, sneezing, using the restroom, coming home and before eating or makng food. ALWAYS wash your hands with soap and water if your hands are visibly dirty.4. If you don't have soap and water, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that has at least 60% alcohol. 5. Clean and disinfect surfaces that people touch a lot (e.g. tables, countertops, light switches, door knobs, cabinet handles). If you or someone in your family gets sick, stay at home, except when getting medical care, until your doctor says you no longer have to stay home. Cover your coughs and sneezes with tissues, and throw the tissue away.	episode_done:True
text: My father has Type 2 diabetes It isn t very severe but I am still concerned for his health Is this type of diabetes considered an underlying condition?	labels: Generally, do not touch the body of someone who has died of COVID-19. We are still learning how COVID-19 spreads and if a deceased body can transmit the virus. One could get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it, and then touching their face (like their mouth, nose, or eyes). Try to avoid kissing washing, and shrouding the body. If washing and shrouding the body are important in your culture or religion, work with your community cultural and religious leaders as well as funeral home staff to try to reduce exposure as much as possible. People who conduct these activities should wear disposable gloves. If fluid splashing is expected, more personal protective equipment may be needed, such as disposable gowns, goggles, and face masks.	episode_done:True

Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, you can use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Clean and disinfect frequently-touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash and wash your hands. Stay home when you are sick. When you must go out, practice social distancing.	episode_done:True
text: My father has Type 2 diabetes It isn t very severe but I am still concerned for his health Is this type of diabetes considered an underlying condition?	labels: Travellers should adhere to strict hygiene measures, wash hands with soap and water regularly, and/or use alcohol-based hand sanitisers. Touching the face with unwashed hands should be avoided. Travellers should avoid contact with sick persons, in particular those with respiratory symptoms and fever. It should be emphasised that older people and those with underlying health conditions should take these precautionary measures very seriously. Travellers who develop any symptoms during or after travel should self-isolate; those developing acute respiratory symptoms within 14 days upon return should be advised to seek immediate medical advice, ideally by phone first to their national healthcare provider.	episode_done:True

text: How long does COVID 19 stay on surfaces?	labels: COVID-19 can spread in a few different ways. It can spread from person to person if you inhale an infected person's respiratory droplets when they sneezes, coughs, or talk. It can also spead if you touch something that an infected person has touched, like a door knob, elevator button, or bathroom faucet.That's why it's important to wash your hands, avoid touching your face, and practice social distancing to avoid getting sick. That's why it's also important to self-isolate and wear a mask around other household members if you are sick to avoid infecting other people.	episode_done:True
text: How long does COVID 19 stay on surfaces?	labels: In the lab, these drugs have been shown to prevent the growth of the virus that causes COVID-19. There are a few reports of patients with COVID-19 who received these drugs and improved. Some are reports of groups of patients, all of whom received the drug. It is not known whether it was the drug that led to the improvement or whether there were other factors involved. We do not know if the treated patients’ condition would have improved without the drug. To know this, there would have to be a group of similar patients who did not receive the drug (control). Because chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine may possibly help very sick patients, FDA is allowing these drugs to be provided to certain hospitalized patients under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) issued March 28, 2020.  Under the EUA, health care providers and patients are provided with information about the risks of these drugs. However, more data from clinical trials are necessary for us to determine whether chloroquine phosphate or hydroxychloroquine sulfate are safe and effective in treating or preventing COVID-19.	episode_done:True

text: Should we avoid online shopping as it puts workings and delivery people at risk?	labels: Quarantine means staying away from other people because you might have been exposed to the virus. For COVID-19, people should quarantine for at least 14 days, or 2 weeks from the time they might have had contact with someone with COVID-19. That's because most people who get COVID-19 would have symptoms within 14 days. Scientists think that people are not likely to spread COVID-19 to others if they do not get sick after 14 days. Remember, every time you could have been exposed to the virus means you should restart your 14 day clock for quarantine.	episode_done:True
text: Should we avoid online shopping as it puts workings and delivery people at risk?	labels: There is currently no evidence that COVID-19 is being spread through the mail.

MERS-CoV stands for "Middle East Respiratory Syndrome- associated Coronavirus."The first cases of MERS-CoV were seen in 2012 in Saudi Arabia. MERS-CoV symptoms are fever, cough, and shortness of breath. People with this disease usually do not get sick from one another unless they are in very close contact.	episode_done:True
text: What is a dry cough?	labels: SARS-CoV stands for "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome-associated CoronaVirus." It is a virus that can cause serious problems with breathing and the lungs. It is different from the virus that has caused the COVID-19 pandemic. The SARS-CoV virus was first found in Asia in 2003 and last known human case was in China in 2004. SARS-CoV spreads through close person to person contact and caused flu like symptoms.	episode_done:True
text: what is the best way to help beside washing my hands?	labels: Together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19 by making a conscious effort to keep a physical distance between each other. Physical (social) distancing is proven to be one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of illness during an outbreak. This means making changes in your everyday routines to minimize close contact with others, including:avoiding crowded places and non-essential gatherings avoiding common greetings, such as handshakes limiting contact with people at higher risk like older adults and those in poor health keeping a distance of at least 2 arms-length (approximately 2 metres) from others	episode_done:True
text: what is the best way to help beside washing my hands?	labels: If there is an outbreak in your community, you should:1. Stay calm! 2. Stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people 3.

Clean surfaces that people touch a lotPlease stay home if you are sick, and limit contact with others as much as you can.Notify your workplace as soon as possible if your regular work schedule will need to change. Ask to work from home or take leave if your or someone in your home gets sick with COVID-19 symptoms or if your child's school is dismissed. If you live alone and have a chronic health problem, please reach out to friends, family, loved ones, and healthcare providers. Also ask them to check in on you. Stay in touch with loved ones by phone or email. This can be a lonely and isolating time, so it is important to practice self-care as well as reach out to others.	episode_done:True
text: what is the best way to help beside washing my hands?	labels: You can reduce your risk of getting sick by:1. Staying at home as much as you can. Only go out when you really need to (for groceries, for example) 2. If you do go out, keep at least 6 foot (2 meter) distance between you and other people. 3. Wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after blowing your nose, coughing, sneezing, using the restroom, coming home and before eating or makng food. ALWAYS wash your hands with soap and water if your hands are visibly dirty.4. If you don't have soap and water, use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that has at least 60% alcohol. 5. Clean and disinfect surfaces that people touch a lot (e.g. tables, countertops, light switches, door knobs, cabinet handles).

text: What are the criteria for swabbing children?	labels: Children under the age of 2 years should not wear any type of masks. Because babies' airways are smaller, breathing through a mask is even harder on them and they are more likely to suffocate if they use a mask. Older infants or young toddlers are not likely to keep the mask on and will likely try to remove it. This will mean they are touching their face more and could infect themselves with the virus. It is safest to keep children at home and follow social distancing.	episode_done:True

"Coronavirus Disease 2019” (which is shortened to "COVID-19") is an example of a type of coronavirus that has recently spread to humans.	episode_done:True
text: Can I get the virus from food?	labels: Right now, COVID-19 mostly spreads from person to person. But experts agree that the virus likely came from bats and may have passed through another type of animal in China before spreading to people. If you are going to travel, check the latest health notices for up-to-date advice before you leave. Avoid contact with animals, including wild meat and live animal markets.Animal importers, rescues, and adoptive families should limit or postpone importing animals from affected areas. If animals are imported from an affected area, monitor them closely for illness. Call a veterinarian if they get sick and call before bringing them to the office so that they can prepare.	episode_done:True
text: Can I get the virus from food?	labels: If you are having symptoms of COVID-19, call your health care provider for a referral. If you do not have a health care provider, call 2-1-1 to be connected with a local community or hospital-connected clinic for a referral to a test site. If you are having a medical emergency, call 9-1-1 or go to the hospital. Health care providers are encouraged to order a test for any child or adult who is showing symptoms of COVID-19, even if their symptoms are mild. Find out what to do if you are sick from the CDC and what to do while youâre waiting for test results. Pop-up Testing Sites Any Vermonter without symptoms can be tested at a pop-up testing site without a doctorâs referral. This includes people who work in Vermont, second homeowners, and college students. Registration for testing is required. For people who do not have internet access and want to register at a pop-up site, they can call 2-1-1 for help with registration. Register for a pop-up testing site. The test is a nasopharyngeal swab, or NP swab, where a health care professional uses a swab to collect a sample from the back of the nose and throat. This test will tell you if you have a current infection. It is not a serology/antibody test, which means it will not tell you if you were infected in the past. The following groups are encouraged to get tested at pop-up sites: health care workers, first responders (EMS, fire, and law enforcement), child care providers currently serving essential workers, and anyone currently under quarantine who has had no symptoms during the first seven days of quarantine. Find more details under âI am under a 14-day quarantine. Can I have the option to be tested and end my quarantine period?â on this page.	episode_done:True
text: Can I get the virus from food?	labels: Right now, we don't know of any clear cases of the virus passing from people to their pets. There was a tiger in a zoo in New York City that seems to have gotten COVID-19 from its caretakers. To be safe, wash your hands before and after touching animals. Until we know more, if you have been diagnosed with COVID-19 and have a pet or other animal, you should:1. Avoid close contact with them. Do not snuggle or kiss them, let them lick you, sit on your lap, or sleep in your bed. 2. Avoid coughing and sneezing on your animals. Cover your coughs and sneezes. 3. Have another member of your household care for your animals, if you can. 4. If it's not possible to have someone else care for your animal, always wash your hands before touching or feeding them. 5. Limit your animal's contact with other people and animals. Tthis may mean keeping them indoors.We might learn more about human to animal spread in the future. Talk to your pet's doctor if you are worried about your pet's health.	episode_done:True

text: How long does COVID 19 stay in the air?	labels: In the lab, these drugs have been shown to prevent the growth of the virus that causes COVID-19. There are a few reports of patients with COVID-19 who received these drugs and improved. Some are reports of groups of patients, all of whom received the drug. It is not known whether it was the drug that led to the improvement or whether there were other factors involved. We do not know if the treated patients’ condition would have improved without the drug. To know this, there would have to be a group of similar patients who did not receive the drug (control). Because chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine may possibly help very sick patients, FDA is allowing these drugs to be provided to certain hospitalized patients under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) issued March 28, 2020.  Under the EUA, health care providers and patients are provided with information about the risks of these drugs.

You can protect yourself from becoming ill by taking the following precautions:stay home as much as possible, except for important medical appointments talk to your doctor, obstetrician or midwife about the possibility of telephone or videoconference appointments avoid unnecessary visitors to your home wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds use alcohol-based hand sanitizer if soap and water are not available practise physical distancing by keeping a distance of at least 2 metres from others avoid touching your mouth, nose and eyes avoid crowded places and peak-hours make limited trips to the store for essentials avoid travel by public transitFor more information, refer to our advice for motherson pregnancy, childbirth and caring for newborns. If you are pregnant and concerned about COVID-19, speak to your health care provider.	episode_done:True
text: How are the symptoms different then the cold or flu?	labels: Children and adults have the same COVID-19 symptoms, although children might not get as sick as adults. Children might get a fever, runny nose, or cough. Some children have had vomiting or diarrhea. We are still learning about how COVID-19 affects children.	episode_done:True
text: How are the symptoms different then the cold or flu?	labels: Those who are infected with COVID-19 may have little to no symptoms. You may not know you have symptoms of COVID-19 because they are similar to a cold or flu. Symptoms haveincluded:cough fever difficulty breathing pneumonia in both lungsIn severe cases, infection can leadto death.Symptoms may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to COVID-19. This is the longest known incubation period for this disease.Recent evidence indicates that the virus can be transmitted to othersfrom someone who is infected but not showing symptoms. This includes peoplewho:have not yet developed symptoms (pre-symptomatic) never develop symptoms (asymptomatic)While experts know that these kinds of transmissions are happening amongthose in close contact or in close physical settings, it is not known to whatextent.

text: What are the risk factors for COVID 19?	labels: COVID-19 is a disease caused by a new type of virus. Sometimes people also call it "coronavirus," which is is the type of virus that causes COVID-19. COVID-19 causes some symptoms that are like getting a cold or flu. But some people get worse symptoms and need more care. COVID-19 is caused by a new type of virus that our body has not seen before. Since our body has not seen it before, our immune system has to learn how to fight off this new virus.	episode_done:True
text: What are the risk factors for COVID 19?	labels: Pregnant women should do the same things as everyone else to avoid COVID-19 infection, including: Avoid close contact with people who are sick. Wash your hands often with soap and water for at least 20 seconds, especially after going to the bathroom; before eating; and after blowing your nose, coughing, or sneezing. If soap and water are not readily available, you can use an alcohol-based hand sanitizer that contains at least 60% alcohol. Clean and disinfect frequently-touched objects and surfaces using a regular household cleaning spray or wipe. Avoid touching your eyes, nose, and mouth with unwashed hands. Cover your cough or sneeze with a tissue, then throw the tissue in the trash and wash your hands. Stay home when you are sick. When you must go out, practice social distancing.	episode_done:True

Let's break it down."SARS" stands for "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome", meaning that it can cause serious problems with breathing and the lungs."COV" stands for "Coronavirus." This is the type of virus that causes COVID-19. The "2" is a way to say that this virus is different than the SARS virus that caused an outbreak in 2002-2003.	episode_done:True
text: What are the risk factors for COVID 19?	labels: People with COVID-19 should receive supportive care to help relieve symptoms. People with mild symptoms are able to recover at home. If you experience a medical emergency such as trouble breathing, call 911 and let the operator know you may have COVID-19. For severe illness, treatment should include care to support vital organ functions.  Currently there are no FDA-approved drugs specifically for the treatment of COVID-19. Researchers are studying new drugs, and drugs that are already approved for other health conditions, as possible treatments for COVID-19. The FDA is working with drug manufacturers, researchers, and other partners to accelerate the development process for COVID-19 treatments. CDC has more information for health care providers about these potential treatments. Never take a prescription medicine or drug if it is not prescribed for you by your doctor for your health condition.	episode_done:True

text: Do we need to prevent touching packing of food does corona virus lie on packing And on clothes?	labels: Current thinking is that COVID-19 mostly spreads from person to person through respiratory droplets. But some studies show that the virus can last on surfaces, so it is possible that someone could get the virus by touching a surface that has the virus on it and then touching their mouth, nose, or eyes.	episode_done:True
text: Do we need to prevent touching packing of food does corona virus lie on packing And on clothes?	labels: A recent study shows that the virus can live in the air and on surfaces from several hours to several days. On plastic, it can live for up to 72 hours (3 days). On stainless steel, it can live for up to 48 hours (2 days). On cardboard, it can live up to 24 hours (1 day). On copper, it can live up to four hours. It is detectable in the air for up to three hours. However, the amount of virus that remains is quite minimal - so the risk is still relatively low to contract COVID-19 from these surfaces.  It is still important to regularly clean and disinfect high-touch surfaces as well as packages and mail that come through. Remember to wash your hands frequently with soap and water or an alcohol based hand sanitizer (60%).	episode_done:True

It is not known whether it was the drug that led to the improvement or whether there were other factors involved. We do not know if the treated patients’ condition would have improved without the drug. To know this, there would have to be a group of similar patients who did not receive the drug (control). Because chloroquine phosphate and hydroxychloroquine may possibly help very sick patients, FDA is allowing these drugs to be provided to certain hospitalized patients under an Emergency Use Authorization (EUA) issued March 28, 2020.  Under the EUA, health care providers and patients are provided with information about the risks of these drugs.

Canada public health services is doing research to try to answer this question.	episode_done:True
text: What are symptoms in the incubation period?	labels: Coronaviruses are a large family of viruses. There are different types of coronaviruses.Some types of coronavirus are more common in people and some versions are more common in animals. Rarely, a type of the virus that was common in animals can spread to people. "Coronavirus Disease 2019” (which is shortened to "COVID-19") is an example of a type of coronavirus that has recently spread to humans.	episode_done:True
text: What are symptoms in the incubation period?	labels: COVID-19 is a disease caused by a new type of virus. Sometimes people also call it "coronavirus," which is is the type of virus that causes COVID-19. COVID-19 causes some symptoms that are like getting a cold or flu. But some people get worse symptoms and need more care. COVID-19 is caused by a new type of virus that our body has not seen before. Since our body has not seen it before, our immune system has to learn how to fight off this new virus.	episode_done:True
text: Can Plaquenil help to prevent coronavirus?	labels: Face masks, including fabric ones, are likely only helpful in preventing people who have COVID-19 from spreading it to others. If you wear a cloth mask, you should still use the same social distancing measures as you would if you were not wearing a mask. This means you should stay at least 6 feet (2 meters) away from other people, wash your hands frequently, and avoid touching your face or eyes.When wearing a mask, make sure it covers your nose and mouth. Wash the mask after you use it every time. When handling the mask, act as though the front of the mask is contaminated. Don't touch the front of the mask when you take it off or put it on.It is not recommended that the general public wear surgical or N95 masks at this time. That is because there are not enough of these masks for health care workers. Health care workers need these masks to stay safe and to take care of sick patients. If you have extra surgical or N95 masks, please donate them to your local healthcare facility.	episode_done:True

text: Can Plaquenil help to prevent coronavirus?	labels: People can fight stigma by providing social support in situations where you notice this is occurring. Stigma affects the emotional or  mental health  of stigmatized groups and the communities they live in. Stopping stigma is important to making communities and community members resilient. See  resources on mental health and coping during COVID-19 . Everyone can help stop stigma related to COVID-19 by  knowing the facts  and sharing them with others in your community.	episode_done:True

text: Can Plaquenil help to prevent coronavirus?	labels: Together, we can slow the spread of COVID-19 by making a conscious effort to keep a physical distance between each other. Physical (social) distancing is proven to be one of the most effective ways to reduce the spread of illness during an outbreak. This means making changes in your everyday routines to minimize close contact with others, including:avoiding crowded places and non-essential gatherings avoiding common greetings, such as handshakes limiting contact with people at higher risk like older adults and those in poor health keeping a distance of at least 2 arms-length (approximately 2 metres) from others	episode_done:True

text: How many days it takes to recover?	labels: The time between exposure to the COVID-19 virus and onset of symptoms is called the “incubation period.” The incubation period for COVID-19 is typically 2 to 14 days, although in some cases it may be longer.	episode_done:True
text: How many days it takes to recover?	labels: There is currently no evidence that COVID-19 is being spread through the mail. Coronaviruses do not survive well on surfaces. So, experts think the risk of spread from products or packages shipped over days or weeks is extremely low.	episode_done:True

text: How many days it takes to recover?	labels: COVID-19 can spread in a few different ways. It can spread from person to person if you inhale an infected person's respiratory droplets when they sneezes, coughs, or talk. It can also spead if you touch something that an infected person has touched, like a door knob, elevator button, or bathroom faucet.That's why it's important to wash your hands, avoid touching your face, and practice social distancing to avoid getting sick. That's why it's also important to self-isolate and wear a mask around other household members if you are sick to avoid infecting other people.	episode_done:True
text: I have a sore throat?	labels: The risk of COVID-19 spreading from products or packaging shipped over a period of days or weeks is likely to be low. Currently, there is no evidence that COVID-19 has been spread from imported goods.	episode_done:True
text: I have a sore throat?	labels: Social distancing helps to reduce the chance of infecting people who are more likely to get severe disease. It helps to stop the virus from spreading quickly. This also helps to prevent there being too many sick people for hospitals to handle.	episode_done:True
text: I have a sore throat?	labels: Staying at home and using "social distancing" helps stop the virus from spreading quickly. This helps to reduce the burden on healthcare systems, as there are not enough hospital workers and beds if too many people get sick at once.Social distancing means staying farther away from other people and avoiding groups of people. Since COVID-19 mostly spreads from person-to-person interactions, staying at least 6 feet away from other people can help stop the spread. It is important to use social distancing because people can spread COVID-19 even if they feel fine. It is especially important to use social distancing to protect people who are more likely to get very sick from the disease.	episode_done:True
text: I have a sore throat?	labels: Generally, do not touch the body of someone who has died of COVID-19. We are still learning how COVID-19 spreads and if a deceased body can transmit the virus. One could get COVID-19 by touching a surface or object that has the virus on it, and then touching their face (like their mouth, nose, or eyes). Try to avoid kissing washing, and shrouding the body. If washing and shrouding the body are important in your culture or religion, work with your community cultural and religious leaders as well as funeral home staff to try to reduce exposure as much as possible. People who conduct these activities should wear disposable gloves. If fluid splashing is expected, more personal protective equipment may be needed, such as disposable gowns, goggles, and face masks.	episode_done:True
text: I have a sore throat?	labels: It is a challenging time with schools, daycares and unversities being closed. Talk to the  school or facility  about their emergency operations plan. Understand the plan for continuing education and social services (such as student meal programs) during school dismissals. If your child attends a  college or university , encourage them to learn about the school’s plan for a COVID-19 outbreak.	episode_done:True
text: Day by day symptoms?	labels: Those who are infected with COVID-19 may have little to no symptoms. You may not know you have symptoms of COVID-19 because they are similar to a cold or flu. Symptoms haveincluded:cough fever difficulty breathing pneumonia in both lungsIn severe cases, infection can leadto death.Symptoms may take up to 14 days to appear after exposure to COVID-19. This is the longest known incubation period for this disease.Recent evidence indicates that the virus can be transmitted to othersfrom someone who is infected but not showing symptoms. This includes peoplewho:have not yet developed symptoms (pre-symptomatic) never develop symptoms (asymptomatic)While experts know that these kinds of transmissions are happening amongthose in close contact or in close physical settings, it is not known to whatextent.
